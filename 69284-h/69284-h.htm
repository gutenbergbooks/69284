<h3>
INTRODUCTION.
</h3>

<p>
Carlyle's <i>Essay on Burns</i> was first printed in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> for December, 1828.  Though in form
a review of the <i>Life of Robert Burns</i>, by John Gibson
Lockhart, it is really, like many of the articles in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, an entirely independent work.  The
present art of book reviewing is a creation of our own
times.  The English magazines of the eighteenth century
were mere publishers' organs, and are inferior to even
second-rate periodicals of our own day.  The book notices
in them are comparable to those that we see in our poorer
daily newspapers.  The reviewers were usually mere
literary hacks, and were content to give a summary of the
contents of a book, and then pass judgment on it as a whole,
meting out praise or blame in set, formal terms.  The
foundation of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, in 1802, by Jeffrey,
Sydney Smith, Brougham, and others, marks the beginning
of a new era in English periodical literature.  The new
magazine had for contributors men of marked learning
and originality, leaders in the thought of their time, who
were not satisfied, in reviewing a book, with recording the
impression that any sane man would gather from a casual
reading, but took the title of the book as the text for a
thoroughly original treatment of its subject.  Succeeding
periodicals, as the <i>Quarterly</i> and <i>Blackwood's</i>, however
much they differed from the <i>Edinburgh</i> in politics and
general tendencies, were all affected by its methods.  So
it happens that many book reviews in the English magazines,
by men like Carlyle, Macaulay, and Matthew Arnold,
have become permanent additions to literature, sometimes
surpassing in interest the works that occasioned them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Piv"></a>iv}</span>
</p>

<p>
In the present case, however, the book reviewed continues
to be a standard authority.  Its author, John Gibson
Lockhart, was born in 1794, at Cambusnethan, about twelve
miles southeast of Glasgow.  When <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>
was founded, in 1817, Lockhart became one of its chief
contributors.  In 1820 he married the eldest daughter of
Sir Walter Scott.  In the years following his marriage he
published several novels, an edition of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and
his translations of <i>Ancient Spanish Ballads</i>.  This last
work has never been superseded, and is often reprinted.
In 1826 he became editor of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, and
retained the position until the year before his death, in
1854.  His <i>Life of Robert Burns</i> appeared in 1828, and a
<i>Life of Napoleon Bonaparte</i> in the next year.  His greatest
work, the <i>Life of Scott</i>, appeared in 1836-38, and by
general consent has taken in English biographical literature
a place second only to that of Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i>.
</p>

<p>
Carlyle was introduced to Lockhart when on a visit to
London, in 1832.  In his Note Book at that time he calls
Lockhart "a precise, brief, active person of considerable
faculty," and confesses that he "rather liked the man."[<a id="chap00bfn1text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn1">1</a>]  A
month later, in a letter to his brother, he calls him "not
without force, but barren and unfruitful."[<a id="chap00bfn2text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn2">2</a>]  Seven years
after this, when Carlyle was settled in London, he formed
the project of writing an article on the working-classes for
the <i>Quarterly</i>; with this in mind he called upon Lockhart,
and, he says, "found him a person of sense, good breeding,
even kindness."[<a id="chap00bfn3text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn3">3</a>]  Ever after this, though the two men were
never intimate friends, they had warm affection and esteem
for each other.  Lockhart feared to accept Carlyle's article
because of its radical opinions, and it was published
separately, under the title of <i>Chartism</i>.  One more link between
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pv"></a>v}</span>
the men is Carlyle's review&mdash;one of his least satisfactory
essays&mdash;of the <i>Life of Scott</i>, published in 1838, in
the <i>London and Westminster Review</i>.  And Carlyle's own
judgment of Lockhart widens our knowledge of the
character of both men.
</p>

<p>
"A hard, proud, but thoroughly honest, singularly intelligent,
and also affectionate man, whom in the distance I
esteemed more than perhaps he ever knew.  Seldom did I
speak to him; but hardly ever without learning and gaining
something."[<a id="chap00bfn4text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Thomas Carlyle was born December 4, 1795, at Annandale,
in Dumfriesshire, in southeast Scotland.  His life
offers many resemblances, though perhaps more contrasts,
to that of Burns.  Like Burns, he came from the strong,
rough stock of the Scotch peasantry.  Of his father, James
Carlyle, a man like Burns's father in his strength of
character and deeply religious temperament, but unlike him
in his complete ignorance of all books except the Bible,
Carlyle has himself left us a grand portrait in the
<i>Reminiscences</i>.  When ten years old, Carlyle was sent to the
Annan grammar school.  Of his life there we may judge
from the veiled account in <i>Sartor Resartus</i>:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My Teachers were hide-bound Pedants, without knowledge
of man's nature, or of boy's; or of aught save their
lexicons and quarterly account-books.  Innumerable dead
Vocables (no dead Language, for they themselves knew
no Language) they crammed into us, and called it
fostering the growth of mind....  The Professors knew syntax
enough; and of the human soul thus much: that it had a
faculty called Memory, and could be acted-on through the
muscular integument by the appliance of birch-rods."[<a id="chap00bfn5text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
James Carlyle recognized his son's ability, and resolved
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvi"></a>vi}</span>
that he should be an educated man.  Yet Carlyle can
hardly be said to have been "sent" to the University, for
he <i>walked</i> the distance of seventy miles over rough
country to Edinburgh.  There he worked industriously in the
library, and laid the foundations for his wonderful
knowledge of books.  He tells us later:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What I have found the University did for me, was that
it taught me to read in various languages and various sciences,
so that I could go into the books that treated of these
things, and try anything I wanted to make myself master
of gradually, as I found it suit me."[<a id="chap00bfn6text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn6">6</a>]
</p>

<p>
Carlyle had been intended for the ministry, but money
was lacking, and he took up school teaching as a temporary
occupation.  In 1818, having saved ninety pounds, he
returned to Edinburgh for study.  Meanwhile, the ministry
had become closed to him, for reading and thought had
undermined his belief in the creed of the Scotch Kirk.
But Carlyle's reaction from his ancestral beliefs was
occasioned by different circumstances from that of Burns.
Carlyle, by deep study and meditation, was stirred from
the dogmas of the Scotch Kirk, but adhered strictly to its
stern, severe code of morals.  Burns, who had a lighter,
more facile nature, became disgusted with the hypocrisy of
those high in church authority, and was attracted by the
more winning characters of the leaders of the progressive
party.  His passions had already weakened his morals;
and though he still professed the highest respect for religion
in the abstract, he was led on from distrust of orthodox
Calvinism to what often seems general skepticism and
indifference on religious matters.
</p>

<p>
After an experiment in legal study, Carlyle finally settled
on his trade as a "writer of books."  From 1818 to 1822
he lived in Edinburgh, and did hack literary work, largely
articles for the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopedia</i>.  In 1822 he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pvii"></a>vii}</span>
became tutor in a private family, with whom he travelled,
not returning to Edinburgh until 1825.  During these years
of indecision as to what should be his life pursuit he had
been occupied with German literature, and had published
his translation of <i>Wilhelm Meister</i> and his <i>Life of Schiller</i>.
For these works he received grateful acknowledgment
from Goethe, and by them established a reputation as
a writer.  In 1827 he met Jeffrey, and made a contract
with him to write for the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in 1826, Carlyle had married Jane Baillie
Welsh.  Two years later, through the failure of some literary
plans, he decided to remove, for the sake of economy, to
his wife's farm of Craigenputtock, in southwest Dumfriesshire,
in the wild moorland country, fifteen miles from any
town.  There he resolved, in spite of poverty, to publish no
work that did not satisfy his ideal.  Carlyle's impressions
of his hermit life vary with his changing moods,&mdash;now he
praises his home as a rural paradise; again he writes in his
diary, "Finished a paper on Burns September 16, 1828, at
this Devil's Den, Craigenputtock."[<a id="chap00bfn7text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn7">7</a>]
</p>

<p>
This last phrase shows us that the <i>Essay on Burns</i> was
one of the first products of Carlyle's self-imposed exile.
Of all his essays, this is on the topic nearest to the author's
life.  Carlyle was drawn to his subject by every bond of
race, language, and association.  His birthplace, Annandale,
is only ten miles from Dumfries, Burns's last home.  He
had talked with many who had known Burns in life, among
them Gilbert Burns, the poet's brother.  Though an
estimate of the merits of the essay will be more appropriate
later, some circumstances connected with its publication
must here be noted, for the light which they throw on
Carlyle's character.  The account of them is quoted, with some
small changes, from Froude.
</p>

<p>
Jeffrey "found the article long and diffuse, though he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pviii"></a>viii}</span>
did not deny that 'it contained much beauty and felicity of
diction.'  He insisted that it must be cut down," and received
permission from Carlyle to make some alterations.[<a id="chap00bfn8text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn8">8</a>]  "When
the proof-sheets came, Carlyle found 'the first part cut all
into shreds,&mdash;the body of a quadruped with the head of a
bird, a man shortened by cutting out the thighs and fixing
the knee-caps on the hips.'[<a id="chap00bfn9text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn9">9</a>]  He refused to let it appear
'in such a horrid shape.'  He replaced the most important
passages, and returned the sheets with an intimation that
the paper might be cancelled, but should not be mutilated.
Few editors would have been so forbearing as Jeffrey when
so audaciously defied.  He complained, but he acquiesced.
He admitted that the article would do the Review credit,
though it would be called tedious and sprawling by people
of weight whose mouths he could have stopped.  He had
wished to be of use to Carlyle by keeping out of sight in
the Review his mannerism and affectation; but if Carlyle
persisted he might have his way.
</p>

<p>
"Carlyle was touched; such kindness was more than he
had looked for.  The proud self-assertion was followed by
humility and almost penitence, and the gentle tone in which
he wrote conquered Jeffrey in turn.  Jeffrey said that he
admired and approved of Carlyle's letter to him in all
respects.  'The candour and sweet blood' which was shown
in it deserved the highest praise.  'Your virtues are your
own,' said Jeffrey, 'and you shall have anything you like.'"[<a id="chap00bfn10text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn10">10</a>]
</p>

<p>
During Carlyle's residence at Craigenputtock, which
lasted, with slight interruption, for six years, were produced
most of the miscellaneous essays, and his first great original
work, <i>Sartor Resartus</i>.  This is the formative period of his
literary life, from which he came forth, to quote
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pix"></a>ix}</span>
Mr. Stephen, "a master of his craft."  In 1834 he moved to
London, where he resided until his death, in 1881.  To
this later period belong his greatest works, on which his
fame depends: <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship</i>, <i>The French
Revolution</i>, <i>Cromwell's Letters and Speeches</i>, and <i>The
History of Frederick the Great</i>.  But the earlier works
have the same tonic quality as the later, and are free from
many of their defects.  As a teacher, especially if we take
an American point of view, Carlyle grows less trustworthy
with advancing years.  His cynicism becomes more bitter,
his hero-worship leads him to sympathize with autocracy,
while his contempt for the stupidity of the masses leads him
to distrust all popular government.  In Lowell's words,
quoting Carlyle's contemptuous phrase, "he saw 'only the
burning of a dirty chimney' in the war which a great people
was waging under his very eyes for the idea of nationality
and orderly magistrature."
</p>

<p>
In the <i>Essay on Burns</i>, then, we have a work of
Carlyle's early prime.  We might infer this from the style
alone, which shows a transition from his early clearness and
simplicity to the "piebald, entangled, hyper-metaphorical
style of writing" characteristic of his later works, and
always associated with his name.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>Essay on Burns</i> it is not the author's intention to
give a connected sketch of Burns's life,[<a id="chap00bfn11text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn11">11</a>] or to pass a cool,
critical judgment on his poetry as a whole.  Carlyle has
himself, on page 6 of this essay, given us his idea of the
true purpose of biography.  The following words from his
second essay on Richter make his meaning still clearer:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If the acted life of a <i>pius Vates</i> is so high a matter,
the written life, which, if properly written, would be a
translation and interpretation thereof, must also have great
value.  It has been said that no Poet is equal to his Poem,
which saying is partially true; but in a deeper sense, it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Px"></a>x}</span>
may also be asserted, and with still greater truth, that no
Poem is equal to its Poet.  Now, it is Biography which
first gives us both Poet and Poem; by the significance of
the one, elucidating and completing that of the other.  That
ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows
forth in his writings, and which, rightly deciphered, will be
truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of
the Biographer to fill up into an actual coherent figure, and
bring home to our experience, or at least clear, undoubting
admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways.
Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men,
especially of great poets, that is, of men in the highest
degree noble minded and wise, might become one of the
most dignified and valuable species of composition.  As
matters stand, indeed, there are few Biographies that
accomplish anything of this kind; the most are mere Indexes
of a Biography, which each reader is to write out for
himself, as he peruses them; not the living body, but the dry
bones of a body, which should have been alive.  To expect
any such Promethean virtue in a common Life-writer were
unreasonable enough.  How shall that unhappy Biographic
brotherhood, instead of writing like Index-makers and
Government-clerks, suddenly become enkindled with some sparks
of intellect, or even of genial fire; and not only collecting
dates and facts, but making use of them, look beyond the
surface and economical form of a man's life, into its
substance and spirit?"
</p>

<p>
In pursuit of this great aim, Carlyle has to adapt his
method to his subject.  In writing of Richter, a man
unknown to the British public of his time, he has to give us
himself the "dry bones" of fact, before he can give the
"living body."  But in the case of Burns, as he can assume
that his readers are familiar with Burns's chief poems, and
know the main events of his life, he brushes aside all
detail, and treats at once the inner meaning and value of the
poet's life and work.  To appreciate Carlyle's essay, we must
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxi"></a>xi}</span>
fulfil his expectation of us, and know Burns at first hand
before we start to read about him.
</p>

<p>
We must now ask how far Carlyle corresponds to his own
ideal biographer.  No one can read this essay without
admitting that we have in it a powerful and sympathetic
conception of Burns.  To decide whether this conception is
just and impartial we must take into account the writer's
general temperament and leading ideas.
</p>

<p>
Carlyle is a hero-worshipper in all his work, as a
quotation from <i>Sartor Resartus</i> will best explain:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Meanwhile, observe with joy, so cunningly has Nature
ordered it, that whatsoever man ought to obey, he cannot but
obey.  Before no faintest revelation of the Godlike did he
ever stand irreverent; least of all, when the Godlike showed
itself revealed in his fellow-man.  Thus there is a true
religious Loyalty forever rooted in his heart; nay in all
ages, even in ours, it manifests itself as a more or less
orthodox <i>Hero-worship</i>.  In which fact, that Hero-worship
exists, has existed, and will forever exist, universally among
Mankind, mayest thou discern the corner-stone of living-rock,
whereon all Politics for the remotest time may stand
secure.
</p>

<p>
"Hast thou forgotten Paris and Voltaire?  How the
aged, withered man, though but a skeptic, mocker, and
millinery Court-poet, yet because even he seemed the Wisest,
Best, could drag mankind at his chariot-wheels, so that
princes coveted a smile from him, and the loveliest of
France would have laid their hair beneath his feet.  All
Paris was one vast Temple of Hero-worship; though their
Divinity, moreover, was of feature too apish."[<a id="chap00bfn12text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p>
As Carlyle is fallible, like other men, the practical effect
of his doctrine is that he exalts those whom he likes, and
throws contempt on those whom he dislikes.  Since he is
attracted by Burns's noble qualities, above all by his
sincerity, he forms a grand ideal conception of him.  Indeed,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxii"></a>xii}</span>
in his <i>Heroes and Hero-Worship</i>, written twelve years later,
he boldly pronounces Burns "the most gifted British soul
we had in all that century of his."  The lecture upon "the
hero as man of letters" should be studied carefully by all
who wish to understand Carlyle's attitude towards the great
writers of the world, and towards Burns as one of them.
It would, however, be of small use to read, as a sort of
postscript to this essay, the half-dozen pages which Carlyle
there devotes especially to Burns.  He there repeats many
of the thoughts of this essay,&mdash;when a writer has once
clearly and fully spoken his mind of a man he cannot well
treat of him again without repetition.  The value of the
lecture on "the hero as man of letters" is, that it gives us
in brief form general ideas, of which the <i>Essay on Burns</i>
is a particular application.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of his conception of Burns as a hero,
Carlyle casts aside, as of slight importance in the general
estimate, evidence that opposes his own view, or even
entirely refuses to believe it.  Thus he dwells on Burns's
finest poems, and pays little heed to his affected English
verse and stilted prose.  Yet they, too, are of Burns's
writing, and demand full consideration, if we are to understand
the whole man.  Again, he will not credit an anecdote
for which there is fairly good evidence, because it shows in
Burns a foolish vanity that seems to him impossible.  So,
at the best, our essay gives only a partial view of Burns.
Those who wish to learn more of the seamy side of the
poet's character will do well to read an essay by as loyal a
son of Scotland, and as kindly and sympathetic a writer, as
Carlyle himself,&mdash;Robert Louis Stevenson.[<a id="chap00bfn13text"></a><a href="#chap00bfn13">13</a>]
</p>

<p>
Much more might be said in dispraise of Carlyle's work,
and yet its essential greatness would remain unaffected.
After the lapse of nearly seventy years, this essay is still
by far our best portrait of Burns.  All succeeding critics
have had to take Carlyle into account.  They may differ
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxiii"></a>xiii}</span>
widely from his conclusions, but they cannot fail to recognize
his transcendent merits.  Though the judgments of Carlyle
on Burns have, in the main, stood well the test of time, yet
in this, as in all his writings, his excellence lies less in his
own opinions than in his power to make others think for
themselves.  Carlyle has little of the finish, proportion,
discrimination, that we find in Matthew Arnold or
Sainte-Beuve.  But for the ordinary reader he is far more useful
than many a writer who comes nearer the absolute truth.
He touches our hearts and arouses our sympathies.  Most
readers of a critic ask, not: "After reading this essay can
I distinguish more accurately between the good and bad
art in my author, and judge better of their comparative
importance?" but: "Does this critic make me more able
to understand the best that is in my poet, so that I share
more deeply in his highest life and thought?"  Let us
then, with due reverence, approach the thoughts of one of
the greatest thinkers of Scotland upon the greatest of her
poets.

<h3>
A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF ROBERT BURNS.
</h3>

<p>
Robert Burns was born on January 25, 1759, in a clay-built
cottage, at Alloway in Ayrshire, in southwest Scotland.
Except for the personal character of his father, his lot was
that of any poor peasant lad.  But the elder Burns had a
natural love of learning, attended carefully to his sons'
education himself, and, further, gave them as good schooling
as it lay in his power to do.  The teacher of Robert Burns
and his younger brother Gilbert was John Murdoch, a
young man of uncommon merit, who interested himself in
the boys, and lent them various books.  Robert grew thoroughly
familiar with his small library, learned French fairly
well, and began Latin.  He was particularly fascinated by
a book of English songs, and carried it with him into the
fields.  He early became noted as the best converser and
the best letter writer in the parish.  When Burns was still
a child his father had removed to another farm, at Mount
Oliphant; later, when Burns was eighteen, to Lochlea, in
the parish of Tarbolton.  The family affairs were never
long prosperous; and the distress endured at Mount
Oliphant from a tyrannical <i>factor</i>, or landlord's agent, is
commemorated in <i>The Twa Dogs</i>, just as the happy home life
is reproduced in <i>The Cotter's Saturday Night</i>.  Through
all his youth Burns was a laborer for his father; and his
first song, <i>Handsome Nell</i>, written when he was only fifteen,
is in honor of a chance partner in the harvest field.
</p>

<p>
In 1782, when he was twenty-three years old, Burns engaged
in business at the town of Irvine, but was reduced to
poverty by the burning of his shop, and returned to Lochlea.
The short residence at the thriving seaport affected for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxv"></a>xv}</span>
worse his habits of life and thought.  Until then Burns
had led an ordinarily correct life; but at Irvine he learned
to drink, and to think lightly of infidelity to women.  <i>The
Poet's Welcome to his Illegitimate Child</i> bears sad witness
to this alteration in his character.
</p>

<p>
In 1784, soon after Burns's return home, his father died,
leaving his affairs in utter ruin.  Three months before his
death Robert and Gilbert had taken the farm of Mossgiel,
in the neighboring parish of Mauchline, and thither the
whole family now removed.  The years 1785 and 1786 are
Burns's great period of poetical production; within them
fall most of the pieces, exclusive of <i>Tam O'Shanter</i> and of
his songs, by which he is now best known.  At this time
the theological controversy between the two parties in the
Scotch Kirk occupied the attention of every one.  Burns
was attracted by the personal character of the leaders of
the <i>New Light</i>, or progressive, party; and aided them in
their warfare upon the <i>Old Light</i> divines by many stinging
satires, notably <i>The Holy Fair</i>, <i>The Twa Herds</i>, and <i>Holy
Willie's Prayer</i>.  Readers to-day have come to have a new
interest in the <i>Old Lights</i>, or <i>Auld Lichts</i>, as the Scotch
term is, through J. M. Barrie's tales and sketches.
</p>

<p>
In 1785 Burns met and fell in love with Jean Armour,
and the next year twin children were born to them.  Burns,
in order to save the girl from disgrace, had given her a
written acknowledgment of marriage; but her father, who
had a poor opinion of the poet's general character, had
forced her to destroy this.  Burns, finding himself without
money or position in society, resolved to emigrate to
Jamaica, and published a thin volume of his poems in order
to raise money for the passage.  The success of the book was
great and immediate, and altered the whole course of Burns's
life.  Dugald Stewart, the philosopher, entertained him at
his house; Henry MacKenzie, the novelist, gave him a
flattering review; and, finally, an enthusiastic letter from
Dr. Blacklock, one of the most celebrated Edinburgh critics,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvi"></a>xvi}</span>
made him decide to give up his plan of flight from his native
country, and to try his fortune at the Scotch capital.  The
volume of poems was also the means of his acquaintance
with the excellent Mrs. Dunlop, with whom he corresponded
until the end of his life.
</p>

<p>
In November, 1786, Burns went to Edinburgh, and was
the "lion" of the following winter.  A new edition of his
poems received three thousand subscribers, and brought him
in about £500.  Of this he lent £180 to his brother Gilbert,
to help in the management of Mossgiel,&mdash;the loan was
finally repaid some thirty years later to the poet's family.
During the following year he made two trips through
Scotland, partly to collect songs, and began to contribute to
Johnson's <i>Scot's Musical Museum</i> and Thomson's <i>Collection
of Scottish Airs</i>.  The poet applied for, and obtained,
a commission in the Excise, the only worldly advantage,
except the profits of his poems, that he derived from his
triumphal Edinburgh season.  Reserving his commission
as a last resort, Burns rented a farm at Ellisland, near
Dumfries, where he settled, in the summer of 1788.  He
had renewed his intimacy with Jean Armour, and, when
she became once more exposed to the anger of her father,
made her all the reparation in his power, by marriage.  The
farm was not a success, and Burns tried to carry on the
Excise business along with it.  When this division of labor
also proved unsatisfactory, he abandoned Ellisland, and, in
November, 1792, moved to Dumfries.
</p>

<p>
At Dumfries Burns was advanced to all Excise division,
with a salary of seventy pounds, and retained the position
until his death.  His hopes of further promotion were cut
off by his ill-timed expressions of sympathy with the
American Revolution, and with the republican party in France.
He attended well to the duties of his office, but occasional
drunkenness and other misconduct brought on him the ill
favor of the "Dumfries aristocracy."  The boon companions
with whom he mingled, and the curious tourists attracted by
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="Pxvii"></a>xvii}</span>
his fame, were in no small measure the cause of his poor
success.  On January 2, 1793, he writes to Mrs. Dunlop:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Occasionally hard drinking is the devil to me.  Against
this I have again and again bent my resolution, and have
greatly succeeded.  Taverns I have totally abandoned: it
is the private parties in the family way, among the
hard-drinking gentlemen of this country, that do me the
mischief."
</p>

<p>
The poet's excesses did not keep him from being an
affectionate father, and attending carefully to his children's
education.  He died on July 21, 1796.
</p>

<p>
Burns's life since leaving Edinburgh had, on the whole,
been one of decline.  With the exception of his songs,
which he never ceased to contribute to Thomson's <i>Collection
of Scottish Airs</i>, and of <i>Tam O'Shanter</i>, written at
Ellisland, he had produced no important poem since that time.
But this sketch of Burns's life must not attempt an estimate
of his character as poet or man.  Its only object is to
furnish for ready reference a few of the facts necessary for
understanding Carlyle's work.

<h3>
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.
</h3>

<p>
Every author should be studied, as far as possible, from his
own writings.  Carlyle's voluminous correspondence furnishes
rich materials for the history of his life and thought.  The best
editions of his letters are those edited by Professor Charles Eliot
Norton: <i>Early Letters of Thomas Carlyle</i> (1814-1826), <i>Letters
of Thomas Carlyle</i> (1826-1836), <i>Correspondence of Thomas
Carlyle and Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>.  These may be supplemented
by Froude's edition of the <i>Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh
Carlyle</i>.  Next to these first-hand documents, Froude's <i>Thomas
Carlyle</i>, in spite of its inaccuracy and its prejudiced point of
view, will remain the great storehouse of information for
students of the subject.  There are good short lives of Carlyle by
John Nichol (<i>English Men of Letters</i> Series) and Richard Garnett
(<i>Great Writers</i> Series).  The former deals more fully in criticism
on his literary work.  There are excellent critical appreciations
of Carlyle by James Russell Lowell, Augustine Birrell (in <i>Obiter
Dicta</i>), and Matthew Arnold (in <i>Essay on Emerson</i>).
</p>

<p>
The best way to study Burns is to learn the outline of the
external events of his life from any short sketch, and then to
read his poems and letters in chronological order.  Besides the
life by Lockhart, there are good accounts of him by Principal
Shairp (<i>English Men of Letters</i> Series) and John Stuart Blackie
(<i>Great Writers</i> Series).  Carlyle mentions by name Currie and
Walker among the biographers of Burns previous to Lockhart.
Dr. James Currie (1756-1805), a famous Scotch physician,
published in 1800 an edition of Burns's works, with an account of
his life, in aid of the poet's family.  The <i>Life of Burns</i>, written
by Josiah Walker, later Professor of Humanity in Glasgow
University, to accompany an edition of Burns's works published in
1811, has no permanent value.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the other two men, Lockhart does not appeal to us as
much by his personal character as by his writings.  The <i>Life
and Letters of John Gibson Lockhart</i>, by Andrew Lang, is the best
book with regard to him.

<h3>
ESSAY ON BURNS.[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]
</h3>

<p><br></p>

<p>
In the modern arrangements of society, it is no
uncommon thing that a man of genius must, like
Butler,[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] "ask for bread and receive a stone;" for, in
spite of our grand maxim of supply and demand, it is
by no means the highest excellence that men are most
forward to recognize.  The inventor of a spinning-jenny
is pretty sure of his reward in his own day; but
the writer of a true poem, like the apostle of a true
religion, is nearly as sure of the contrary.  We do
not know whether it is not an aggravation of the
injustice, that there is generally a posthumous
retribution.  Robert Burns, in the course of Nature, might
yet have been living; but his short life was spent in
toil and penury; and he died, in the prime of his
manhood, miserable and neglected: and yet already
a brave mausoleum shines over his dust,[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>] and more
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P2"></a>2}</span>
than one splendid monument has been reared in other
places to his fame; the street where he languished in
poverty is called by his name;[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>] the highest personages
in our literature have been proud to appear as
his commentators and admirers; and here is the <i>sixth</i>
narrative of his life that has been given to the world![<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lockhart thinks it necessary to apologize for
this new attempt on such a subject: but his readers,
we believe, will readily acquit him; or, at worst, will
censure only the performance of his task, not the
choice of it.  The character of Burns, indeed, is a
theme that cannot easily become either trite or
exhausted; and will probably gain rather than lose in
its dimensions by the distance to which it is removed
by Time.  No man, it has been said, is a hero to his
valet; and this is probably true; but the fault is at
least as likely to be the valet's as the hero's.  For it
is certain, that to the vulgar eye few things are
wonderful that are not distant.  It is difficult for men to
believe that the man, the mere man whom they see,
nay perhaps painfully feel toiling at their side through
the poor jostlings of existence, can be made of finer
clay than themselves.  Suppose that some dining
acquaintance of Sir Thomas Lucy's, and neighbor of
John a Combe's,[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>] had snatched an hour or two from
the preservation of his game, and written us a Life
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P3"></a>3}</span>
of Shakespeare!  What dissertations should we not
have had,&mdash;not on "Hamlet" and "The Tempest,"
but on the wool-trade, and deer-stealing, and the libel
and vagrant laws; and how the Poacher became a
Player; and how Sir Thomas and Mr. John had
Christian bowels, and did not push him to extremities!
In like manner, we believe, with respect to
Burns, that till the companions of his pilgrimage,
the Honorable Excise Commissioners, and the
Gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt,[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>] and the Dumfries
Aristocracy, and all the Squires and Earls, equally
with the Ayr Writers,[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>] and the New and Old Light
Clergy, whom he had to do with, shall have become
invisible in the darkness of the Past, or visible only
by light borrowed from <i>his</i> juxtaposition, it will be
difficult to measure him by any true standard, or to
estimate what he really was and did, in the eighteenth
century, for his country and the world.  It will be
difficult, we say; but still a fair problem for literary
historians; and repeated attempts will give us
repeated approximations.
</p>

<p>
His former Biographers have done something, no
doubt, but by no means a great deal, to assist us.
Dr. Currie and Mr. Walker, the principal of these
writers, have both, we think, mistaken one essentially
important thing: Their own and the world's true
relation to their author, and the style in which it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P4"></a>4}</span>
became such men to think and to speak of such a man.
Dr. Currie loved the poet truly; more perhaps than
he avowed to his readers, or even to himself; yet he
everywhere introduces him with a certain patronizing,
apologetic air: as if the polite public might think
it strange and half unwarrantable that he, a man
of science, a scholar and gentleman, should do such
honor to a rustic.  In all this, however, we readily
admit that his fault was not want of love, but weakness
of faith; and regret that the first and kindest
of all our poet's biographers should not have seen
farther, or believed more boldly what he saw.
Mr. Walker offends more deeply in the same kind: and
both err alike in presenting us with a detached
catalogue of his several supposed attributes, virtues and
vices, instead of a delineation of the resulting
character as a living unity.  This, however, is not
painting a portrait; but gauging the length and breadth
of the several features, and jotting down their
dimensions in arithmetical ciphers.  Nay, it is not so
much as that: for we are yet to learn by what arts
or instruments the mind <i>could</i> be so measured and
gauged.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Lockhart, we are happy to say, has avoided
both these errors.  He uniformly treats Burns as
the high and remarkable man the public voice has
now pronounced him to be: and in delineating him,
he has avoided the method of separate generalities,
and rather sought for characteristic incidents, habits,
actions, sayings; in a word, for aspects which exhibit
the whole man, as he looked and lived among his
fellows.  The book accordingly, with all its deficiencies,
gives more insight, we think, into the true character
of Burns than any prior biography: though, being
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P5"></a>5}</span>
written on the very popular and condensed scheme of
an article for "Constable's Miscellany,"[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>] it has less
depth than we could have wished and expected from
a writer of such power; and contains rather more,
and more multifarious quotations than belong of right
to an original production.  Indeed, Mr. Lockhart's
own writing is generally so good, so clear, direct and
nervous, that we seldom wish to see it making place
for another man's.  However, the spirit of the work
is throughout candid, tolerant and anxiously
conciliating; compliments and praises are liberally
distributed, on all hands, to great and small; and, as
Mr. Morris Birkbeck[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>] observes of the society in the
backwoods of America, "the courtesies of polite life
are never lost sight of for a moment."  But there are
better things than these in the volume; and we can
safely testify, not only that it is easily and pleasantly
read a first time, but may even be without difficulty
read again.[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P6"></a>6}</span>
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, we are far from thinking that the
problem of Burns's Biography has yet been adequately
solved.  We do not allude so much to deficiency of
facts or documents,&mdash;though of these we are still
every day receiving some fresh accession,&mdash;as to the
limited and imperfect application of them to the great
end of Biography.  Our notions upon this subject
may perhaps appear extravagant; but if an individual
is really of consequence enough to have his life
and character recorded for public remembrance, we
have always been of opinion that the public ought to
be made acquainted with all the inward springs and
relations of his character.  How did the world and
man's life, from his particular position, represent
themselves to his mind?  How did co-existing
circumstances modify him from without; how did he
modify these from within?  With what endeavors
and what efficacy rule over them; with what
resistance and what suffering sink under them?  In one
word, what and how produced was the effect of
society on him; what and how produced was his effect
on society?  He who should answer these questions,
in regard to any individual, would, as we believe,
furnish a model of perfection in Biography.  Few
individuals, indeed, can deserve such a study; and
many <i>lives</i> will be written, and, for the gratification
of innocent curiosity, ought to be written, and read
and forgotten, which are not in this sense <i>biographies</i>.
But Burns, if we mistake not, is one of these few
individuals; and such a study, at least with such a
result, he has not yet obtained.  Our own contributions
to it, we are aware, can be but scanty and
feeble; but we offer them with good-will, and trust
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P7"></a>7}</span>
they may meet with acceptance from those they are
intended for.[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>]
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Burns first came upon the world as a prodigy; and
was, in that character, entertained by it, in the usual
fashion, with loud, vague, tumultuous wonder, speedily
subsiding into censure and neglect; till his early
and most mournful death again awakened an enthusiasm
for him, which, especially as there was now
nothing to be done, and much to be spoken, has
prolonged itself even to our own time.  It is true, the
"nine days" have long since elapsed; and the very
continuance of this clamor proves that Burns was no
vulgar wonder.  Accordingly, even in sober judgments,
where, as years passed by, he has come to rest
more and more exclusively on his own intrinsic merits,
and may now be well-nigh shorn of that casual radiance,
he appears not only as a true British poet, but
as one of the most considerable British men of the
eighteenth century.  Let it not be objected that he
did little.  He did much, if we consider where and
how.  If the work performed was small, we must
remember that he had his very materials to discover;
for the metal he worked in lay hid under the desert
moor, where no eye but his had guessed its existence;
and we may almost say, that with his own hand he
had to construct the tools for fashioning it.  For
he found himself in deepest obscurity, without help,
without instruction, without model; or with models
only of the meanest sort.  An educated man stands,
as it were, in the midst of a boundless arsenal and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P8"></a>8}</span>
magazine, filled with all the weapons and engines
which man's skill has been able to devise from the
earliest time; and he works, accordingly, with a
strength borrowed from all past ages.  How different
is his state who stands on the outside of that
storehouse, and feels that its gates must be stormed, or
remain forever shut against him!  His means are the
commonest and rudest; the mere work done is no
measure of his strength.  A dwarf behind his
steam-engine may remove mountains; but no dwarf will
hew them down with a pickaxe; and he must be a
Titan that hurls them abroad with his arms.
</p>

<p>
It is in this last shape that Burns presents himself.
Born in an age the most prosaic Britain had yet seen,
and in a condition the most disadvantageous, where
his mind, if it accomplished aught, must accomplish
it under the pressure of continual bodily toil, nay
of penury and desponding apprehension of the worst
evils, and with no furtherance but such knowledge
as dwells in a poor man's hut, and the rhymes of a
Ferguson or Ramsay[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>] for his standard of beauty, he
sinks not under all these impediments: through the
fogs and darkness of that obscure region, his lynx
eye discerns the true relations of the world and human
life; he grows into intellectual strength, and trains
himself into intellectual expertness.  Impelled by the
expansive movement of his own irrepressible soul, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P9"></a>9}</span>
struggles forward into the general view; and with
haughty modesty lays down before us, as the fruit
of his labor, a gift which Time has now pronounced
imperishable.  Add to all this, that his darksome
drudging childhood and youth was by far the kindliest
era of his whole life; and that he died in his
thirty-seventh year: and then ask, If it be strange
that his poems are imperfect, and of small extent, or
that his genius attained no mastery in its art?  Alas,
his Sun shone as through a tropical tornado; and the
pale Shadow of Death eclipsed it at noon!  Shrouded
in such baleful vapors, the genius of Burns was never
seen in clear azure splendor, enlightening the world:
but some beams from it did, by fits, pierce through;
and it tinted those clouds with rainbow and orient
colors, into a glory and stern grandeur, which men
silently gazed on with wonder and tears!
</p>

<p>
We are anxious not to exaggerate; for it is exposition
rather than admiration that our readers require
of us here; and yet to avoid some tendency to that
side is no easy matter.  We love Burns, and we pity
him; and love and pity are prone to magnify.  Criticism,
it is sometimes thought, should be a cold business;
we are not so sure of this;[<a id="chap01fn14text"></a><a href="#chap01fn14">14</a>] but, at all events,
our concern with Burns is not exclusively that of
critics.  True and genial as his poetry must appear,
it is not chiefly as a poet, but as a man, that he
interests and affects us.  He was often advised to write
a tragedy;[<a id="chap01fn15text"></a><a href="#chap01fn15">15</a>] time and means were not lent him for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
this; but through life he enacted a tragedy, and one
of the deepest.  We question whether the world has
since witnessed so utterly sad a scene; whether
Napoleon himself, left to brawl with Sir Hudson Lowe,
and perish on his rock, "amid the melancholy main,"
presented to the reflecting mind such a "spectacle of
pity and fear" as did this intrinsically nobler,
gentler and perhaps greater soul, wasting itself away in
a hopeless struggle with base entanglements, which
coiled closer and closer round him till only death
opened him an outlet.  Conquerors are a class of men
with whom, for most part, the world could well
dispense; nor can the hard intellect, the unsympathizing
loftiness and high but selfish enthusiasm of such
persons inspire us in general with any affection; at best
it may excite amazement; and their fall, like that of
a pyramid, will be beheld with a certain sadness and
awe.  But a true Poet, a man in whose heart resides
some effluence of Wisdom, some tone of the "Eternal
Melodies," is the most precious gift that can be
bestowed on a generation: we see in him a freer, purer
development of whatever is noblest in ourselves; his
life is a rich lesson to us; and we mourn his death as
that of a benefactor who loved and taught us.[<a id="chap01fn16text"></a><a href="#chap01fn16">16</a>]
</p>

<p>
Such a gift had Nature, in her bounty, bestowed
on us in Robert Burns; but with queenlike indifference
she cast it from her hand, like a thing of no
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
moment; and it was defaced and torn asunder, as an
idle bauble, before we recognized it.  To the
ill-starred Burns was given the power of making man's
life more venerable, but that of wisely guiding his
own life was not given.  Destiny,&mdash;for so in our
ignorance we must speak,&mdash;his faults, the faults of
others, proved too hard for him; and that spirit,
which might have soared could it but have walked,
soon sank to the dust, its glorious faculties trodden
under foot in the blossom; and died, we may almost
say, without ever having lived.  And so kind and
warm a soul; so full of inborn riches, of love to all
living and lifeless things!  How his heart flows out
in sympathy over universal Nature; and in her bleakest
provinces discerns a beauty and a meaning!  The
"Daisy" falls not unheeded under his ploughshare;
nor the ruined nest of that "wee, cowering, timorous
beastie," cast forth, after all its provident pains, to
"thole the sleety dribble and cranreuch cauld."[<a id="chap01fn17text"></a><a href="#chap01fn17">17</a>]  The
"hoar visage" of Winter delights him; he dwells
with a sad and oft-returning fondness in these scenes
of solemn desolation; but the voice of the tempest
becomes an anthem to his ears; he loves to walk in
the sounding woods, for "it raises his thoughts to
<i>Him that walketh on the wings of the wind</i>."[<a id="chap01fn18text"></a><a href="#chap01fn18">18</a>]  A
true Poet-soul, for it needs but to be struck, and the
sound it yields will be music!  But observe him
chiefly as he mingles with his brother men.  What
warm, all-comprehending fellow-feeling; what
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
trustful, boundless love; what generous exaggeration of
the object loved!  His rustic friend, his nut-brown
maiden, are no longer mean and homely, but a hero
and a queen, whom he prizes as the paragons of
Earth.  The rough scenes of Scottish life, not seen
by him in any Arcadian illusion, but in the rude
contradiction, in the smoke and soil of a too harsh
reality, are still lovely to him: Poverty is indeed his
companion, but Love also, and Courage; the simple
feelings, the worth, the nobleness, that dwell under
the straw roof, are dear and venerable to his heart:
and thus over the lowest provinces of man's existence
he pours the glory of his own soul; and they rise, in
shadow and sunshine, softened and brightened into a
beauty which other eyes discern not in the highest.
He has a just self-consciousness, which too often
degenerates into pride; yet it is a noble pride, for
defence, not for offence; no cold suspicious feeling,
but a frank and social one.  The Peasant Poet bears
himself, we might say, like a King in exile: he is
cast among the low, and feels himself equal to the
highest; yet he claims no rank, that none may be
disputed to him.  The forward he can repel, the
supercilious he can subdue; pretensions of wealth or
ancestry are of no avail with him; there is a fire in that
dark eye, under which the "insolence of condescension"
cannot thrive.  In his abasement, in his extreme
need, he forgets not for a moment the majesty
of Poetry and Manhood.  And yet, far as he feels
himself above common men, he wanders not apart
from them, but mixes warmly in their interests; nay
throws himself into their arms, and, as it were,
entreats them to love him.  It is moving to see how, in
his darkest despondency, this proud being still seeks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P13"></a>13}</span>
relief from friendship; unbosoms himself, often to
the unworthy; and, amid tears, strains to his glowing
heart a heart that knows only the name of friendship.
And yet he was "quick to learn;" a man of keen
vision, before whom common disguises afforded no
concealment.  His understanding saw through the
hollowness even of accomplished deceivers; but there
was a generous credulity in his heart.  And so did
our Peasant show himself among us; "a soul like an
Æolian harp, in whose strings the vulgar wind, as
it passed through them, changed itself into articulate
melody."[<a id="chap01fn19text"></a><a href="#chap01fn19">19</a>]  And this was he for whom the world
found no fitter business than quarrelling with
smugglers and vintners, computing excise-dues upon
tallow, and gauging ale-barrels!  In such toils was that
mighty Spirit sorrowfully wasted: and a hundred
years may pass on before another such is given us to
waste.

<p>
All that remains of Burns, the Writings he has
left, seem to us, as we hinted above, no more than a
poor mutilated fraction of what was in him; brief,
broken glimpses of a genius that could never show
itself complete; that wanted all things for completeness:
culture, leisure, true effort, nay even length of
life.  His poems are, with scarcely any exception,
mere occasional effusions; poured forth with little
premeditation; expressing, by such means as offered,
the passion, opinion, or humor of the hour.  Never
in one instance was it permitted him to grapple with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
any subject with the full collection of his strength, to
fuse and mould it in the concentrated fire of his
genius.  To try by the strict rules of Art such imperfect
fragments, would be at once unprofitable and unfair.
Nevertheless, there is something in these poems,
marred and defective as they are, which forbids the
most fastidious student of poetry to pass them by.
Some sort of enduring quality they must have: for
after fifty years of the wildest vicissitudes in poetic
taste, they still continue to be read; nay are read
more and more eagerly, more and more extensively;
and this not only by literary virtuosos, and that class
upon whom transitory causes operate most strongly,
but by all classes, down to the most hard, unlettered
and truly natural class, who read little, and especially
no poetry, except because they find pleasure in it.
The grounds of so singular and wide a popularity,
which extends, in a literal sense, from the palace
to the hut, and over all regions where the English
tongue is spoken, are well worth inquiring into.
After every just deduction, it seems to imply some rare
excellence in these works.  What is that excellence?
</p>

<p>
To answer this question will not lead us far.  The
excellence of Burns is, indeed, among the rarest,
whether in poetry or prose; but, at the same time, it
is plain and easily recognized: his <i>Sincerity</i>, his
indisputable air of Truth.  Here are no fabulous woes
or joys; no hollow fantastic sentimentalities; no
wire-drawn refinings, either in thought or feeling: the
passion that is traced before us has glowed in a living
heart; the opinion he utters has risen in his own
understanding, and been a light to his own steps.  He
does not write from hearsay, but from sight and
experience; it is the scenes that he has lived and labored
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
amidst, that he describes: those scenes, rude and
humble as they are, have kindled beautiful emotions
in his soul, noble thoughts, and definite resolves;
and he speaks forth what is in him, not from any
outward call of vanity or interest, but because his
heart is too full to be silent.  He speaks it with such
melody and modulation as he can; "in homely rustic
jingle;" but it is his own, and genuine.  This is the
grand secret for finding readers and retaining them:
let him who would move and convince others, be first
moved and convinced himself.  Horace's rule, <i>Si vis
me flere</i>,[<a id="chap01fn20text"></a><a href="#chap01fn20">20</a>] is applicable in a wider sense than the literal
one.  To every poet, to every writer, we might say:
Be true, if you would be believed.  Let a man but
speak forth with genuine earnestness the thought, the
emotion, the actual condition of his own heart; and
other men, so strangely are we all knit together by
the tie of sympathy, must and will give heed to him.
In culture, in extent of view, we may stand above
the speaker, or below him; but in either case, his
words, if they are earnest and sincere, will find some
response within us; for in spite of all casual varieties
in outward rank or inward, as face answers to face,
so does the heart of man to man.[<a id="chap01fn21text"></a><a href="#chap01fn21">21</a>]
</p>

<p>
This may appear a very simple principle, and one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P16"></a>16}</span>
which Burns had little merit in discovering.  True,
the discovery is easy enough: but the practical appliance
is not easy; is indeed the fundamental difficulty
which all poets have to strive with, and which scarcely
one in the hundred ever fairly surmounts.  A head
too dull to discriminate the true from the false; a
heart too dull to love the one at all risks, and to hate
the other in spite of all temptations, are alike fatal
to a writer.  With either, or as more commonly happens,
with both of these deficiencies combine a love
of distinction, a wish to be original, which is seldom
wanting, and we have Affectation, the bane of literature,
as Cant, its elder brother, is of morals.  How
often does the one and the other front us, in poetry,
as in life!  Great poets themselves are not always
free of this vice; nay it is precisely on a certain sort
and degree of greatness that it is most commonly
ingrafted.  A strong effort after excellence will
sometimes solace itself with a mere shadow of success;
he who has much to unfold, will sometimes unfold
it imperfectly.  Byron, for instance, was no common
man: yet if we examine his poetry with this view,
we shall find it far enough from faultless.  Generally
speaking, we should say that it is not true.  He
refreshes us, not with the divine fountain, but too
often with vulgar strong waters, stimulating indeed to
the taste, but soon ending in dislike, or even nausea.
Are his Harolds and Giaours, we would ask, real
men; we mean, poetically consistent and conceivable
men?  Do not these characters, does not the character
of their author, which more or less shines through
them all, rather appear a thing put on for the
occasion; no natural or possible mode of being, but
something intended to look much grander than nature?
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
Surely, all these stormful agonies, this volcanic
heroism, superhuman contempt and moody desperation,
with so much scowling, and teeth-gnashing, and other
sulphurous humor, is more like the brawling of a
player in some paltry tragedy, which is to last three
hours, than the bearing of a man in the business of
life, which is to last threescore and ten years.  To
our minds there is a taint of this sort, something
which we should call theatrical, false, affected, in
every one of these otherwise so powerful pieces.
Perhaps "Don Juan," especially the latter parts of it, is
the only thing approaching to a <i>sincere</i> work, he
ever wrote; the only work where he showed himself,
in any measure, as he was; and seemed so intent on
his subject as, for moments, to forget himself.  Yet
Byron hated this vice; we believe, heartily detested
it: nay he had declared formal war against it in
words.  So difficult is it even for the strongest to
make this primary attainment, which might seem the
simplest of all: <i>to read its own consciousness without
mistakes</i>, without errors involuntary or wilful!  We
recollect no poet of Burns's susceptibility who comes
before us from the first, and abides with us to the
last, with such a total want of affectation.  He is an
honest man, and an honest writer.  In his successes
and his failures, in his greatness and his littleness, he
is ever clear, simple, true, and glitters with no lustre
but his own.  We reckon this to be a great virtue;
to be, in fact, the root of most other virtues, literary
as well as moral.
</p>

<p>
Here, however, let us say, it is to the poetry of
Burns that we now allude; to those writings which he
had time to meditate, and where no special reason
existed to warp his critical feeling, or obstruct his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
endeavor to fulfil it.  Certain of his Letters, and
other fractions of prose composition, by no means
deserve this praise.  Here, doubtless, there is not
the same natural truth of style; but on the contrary,
something not only stiff, but strained and twisted; a
certain high-flown inflated tone; the stilting emphasis
of which contrasts ill with the firmness and rugged
simplicity of even his poorest verses.  Thus no man,
it would appear, is altogether unaffected.  Does not
Shakespeare himself sometimes premeditate the sheerest
bombast!  But even with regard to these Letters
of Burns, it is but fair to state that he had two
excuses.  The first was his comparative deficiency in
language.  Burns, though for most part he writes
with singular force and even gracefulness, is not
master of English prose, as he is of Scotch verse;
not master of it, we mean, in proportion to the depth
and vehemence of his matter.  These Letters strike
us as the effort of a man to express something which
he has no organ fit for expressing.  But a second and
weightier excuse is to be found in the peculiarity of
Burns's social rank.  His correspondents are often
men whose relation to him he has never accurately
ascertained; whom therefore he is either forearming
himself against, or else unconsciously flattering, by
adopting the style he thinks will please them.[<a id="chap01fn22text"></a><a href="#chap01fn22">22</a>]  At
all events, we should remember that these faults,
even in his Letters, are not the rule, but the
exception.  Whenever he writes, as one would ever wish
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
to do, to trusted friends and on real interests, his
style becomes simple, vigorous, expressive, sometimes
even beautiful.  His letters to Mrs. Dunlop are
uniformly excellent.
</p>

<p>
But we return to his Poetry.  In addition to its
Sincerity, it has another peculiar merit, which
indeed is but a mode, or perhaps a means, of the
fore-going: this displays itself in his choice of subjects;
or rather in his indifference as to subjects, and the
power he has of making all subjects interesting.  The
ordinary poet, like the ordinary man, is forever
seeking in external circumstances the help which can
be found only in himself.  In what is familiar and
near at hand, he discerns no form or comeliness:
home is not poetical but prosaic; it is in some past,
distant, conventional heroic world, that poetry
resides; were he there and not here, were he thus and
not so, it would be well with him.  Hence our
innumerable host of rose-colored Novels and iron-mailed
Epics, with their locality not on the Earth, but
somewhere nearer to the Moon.  Hence our Virgins of
the Sun, and our Knights of the Cross, malicious
Saracens in turbans, and copper-colored Chiefs in
wampum, and so many other truculent figures from
the heroic times or the heroic climates, who on all
hands swarm in our poetry.  Peace be with them!
But yet, as a great moralist proposed preaching to
the men of this century, so would we fain preach to
the poets, "a sermon on the duty of staying at home."  Let
them be sure that heroic ages and heroic climates
can do little for them.  That form of life has attraction
for us, less because it is better or nobler than
our own, than simply because it is different; and
even this attraction must be of the most transient
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
sort.  For will not our own age, one day, be an
ancient one; and have as quaint a costume as the rest;
not contrasted with the rest, therefore, but ranked
along with them, in respect of quaintness?  Does
Homer interest us now, because he wrote of what
passed beyond his native Greece, and two centuries
before he was born; or because he wrote what passed
in God's world, and in the heart of man, which is
the same after thirty centuries?  Let our poets look
to this: is their feeling really finer, truer, and their
vision deeper than that of other men,&mdash;they have
nothing to fear, even from the humblest subject; is it
not so,&mdash;they have nothing to hope, but an ephemeral
favor, even from the highest.[<a id="chap01fn23text"></a><a href="#chap01fn23">23</a>]
</p>

<p>
The poet, we imagine, can never have far to seek
for a subject: the elements of his art are in him, and
around him on every hand; for him the Ideal world
is not remote from the Actual, but under it and
within it: nay he is a poet, precisely because he can
discern it there.  Wherever there is a sky above him,
and a world around him, the poet is in his place; for
here too is man's existence, with its infinite longings
and small acquirings; its ever-thwarted, ever-renewed
endeavors; its unspeakable aspirations, its fears and
hopes that wander through Eternity; and all the
mystery of brightness and of gloom that it was ever
made of, in any age or climate, since man first began
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
to live.  Is there not the fifth act of a Tragedy in
every deathbed, though it were a peasant's, and a bed
of heath?  And are wooings and weddings obsolete,
that there can be Comedy no longer?  Or are men
suddenly grown wise, that Laughter must no longer
shake his sides, but be cheated of his Farce?  Man's
life and nature is, as it was, and as it will ever be.
But the poet must have an eye to read these things,
and a heart to understand them; or they come and
pass away before him in vain.  He is a <i>vates</i>, a seer;
a gift of vision has been given him.  Has life no
meanings for him, which another cannot equally
decipher? then he is no poet, and Delphi itself will not
make him one.
</p>

<p>
In this respect, Burns, though not perhaps absolutely
a great poet, better manifests his capability,
better proves the truth of his genius, than if he had
by his own strength kept the whole Minerva Press[<a id="chap01fn24text"></a><a href="#chap01fn24">24</a>]
going, to the end of his literary course.  He shows
himself at least a poet of Nature's own making; and
Nature, after all, is still the grand agent in making
poets.  We often hear of this and the other external
condition being requisite for the existence of a poet.
Sometimes it is a certain sort of training; he must
have studied certain things, studied, for instance,
"the elder dramatists," and so learned a poetic
language; as if poetry lay in the tongue, not in the
heart.  At other times we are told he must be bred
in a certain rank, and must be on a confidential footing
with the higher classes; because, above all things,
he must see the world.  As to seeing the world, we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
apprehend this will cause him little difficulty, if he
have but eyesight to see it with.  Without eyesight,
indeed, the task might be hard.  The blind or the
purblind man "travels from Dan to Beersheba, and
finds it all barren."  But happily every poet is born
in the world; and sees it, with or against his will,
every day and every hour he lives.  The mysterious
workmanship of man's heart, the true light and the
inscrutable darkness of man's destiny, reveal themselves
not only in capital cities and crowded saloons,
but in every hut and hamlet where men have their
abode.  Nay, do not the elements of all human
virtues and all human vices; the passions at once of a
Borgia and of a Luther, lie written, in stronger or
fainter lines, in the consciousness of every individual
bosom, that has practised honest self-examination?
Truly, this same world may be seen in Mossgiel and
Tarbolton, if we look well, as clearly as it ever came
to light in Crockford's,[<a id="chap01fn25text"></a><a href="#chap01fn25">25</a>] or the Tuileries itself.
</p>

<p>
But sometimes still harder requisitions are laid on
the poor aspirant to poetry; for it is hinted that he
should have <i>been born</i> two centuries ago; inasmuch
as poetry, about that date, vanished from the earth,
and became no longer attainable by men![<a id="chap01fn26text"></a><a href="#chap01fn26">26</a>]  Such
cobweb speculations have, now and then, overhung
the field of literature; but they obstruct not the
growth of any plant there: the Shakespeare or the
Burns, unconsciously and merely as he walks onward,
silently brushes them away.  Is not every genius an
impossibility till he appear?  Why do we call him
new and original, if we saw where his marble was
lying, and what fabric he could rear from it?  It is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
not the material but the workman that is wanting.
It is not the dark place that hinders, but the dim eye.
A Scottish peasant's life was the meanest and rudest
of all lives, till Burns became a poet in it, and a
poet of it; found it a man's life, and therefore
significant to men.  A thousand battlefields remain unsung;
but the "Wounded Hare" has not perished without
its memorial; a balm of mercy yet breathes on us
from its dumb agonies, because a poet was there.
Our "Halloween" had passed and repassed, in rude
awe and laughter, since the era of the Druids; but
no Theocritus, till Burns, discerned in it the materials
of a Scottish Idyl: neither was the "Holy Fair"
any Council of Trent or Roman Jubilee; but
nevertheless, Superstition and Hypocrisy and Fun having
been propitious to him, in this man's hand it became
a poem, instinct with satire and genuine comic life.[<a id="chap01fn27text"></a><a href="#chap01fn27">27</a>]  Let
but the true poet be given us, we repeat it, place
him where and how you will, and true poetry will not
be wanting.
</p>

<p>
Independently of the essential gift of poetic
feeling, as we have now attempted to describe it, a
certain rugged sterling worth pervades whatever Burns
has written; a virtue, as of green fields and mountain
breezes, dwells in his poetry; it is redolent of
natural life and hardy natural men.  There is a decisive
strength in him, and yet a sweet native gracefulness:
he is tender, he is vehement, yet without constraint
or too visible effort; he melts the heart, or
inflames it, with a power which seems habitual and
familiar to him.  We see that in this man there was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
the gentleness, the trembling pity of a woman, with
the deep earnestness, the force and passionate ardor
of a hero.  Tears lie in him, and consuming fire; as
lightning lurks in the drops of the summer cloud.
He has a resonance in his bosom for every note of
human feeling; the high and the low, the sad, the
ludicrous, the joyful, are welcome in their turns to
his "lightly-moved and all-conceiving spirit."  And
observe with what a fierce prompt force he grasps his
subject, be it what it may!  How he fixes, as it were,
the full image of the matter in his eye; full and clear
in every lineament; and catches the real type and
essence of it, amid a thousand accidents and superficial
circumstances, no one of which misleads him!
Is it of reason; some truth to be discovered?  No
sophistry, no vain surface-logic detains him; quick,
resolute, unerring, he pierces through into the
marrow of the question; and speaks his verdict with an
emphasis that cannot be forgotten.  Is it of description
some visual object to be represented?  No poet
of any age or nation is more graphic than Burns:
the characteristic features disclose themselves to him
at a glance; three lines from his hand and we have
a likeness.  And, in that rough dialect, in that rude,
often awkward metre, so clear and definite a likeness!
It seems a draughtsman working with a burnt stick;
and yet the burin of a Retzsch[<a id="chap01fn28text"></a><a href="#chap01fn28">28</a>] is not more
expressive or exact.
</p>

<p>
Of[<a id="chap01fn29text"></a><a href="#chap01fn29">29</a>] this last excellence, the plainest and most
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P25"></a>25}</span>
comprehensive of all, being indeed the root and foundation
of <i>every</i> sort of talent, poetical or intellectual, we
could produce innumerable instances from the writings
of Burns.  Take these glimpses of a snowstorm
from his "Winter Night" (the italics are ours):&mdash;

This clearness of sight we have called the foundation
of all talent; for in fact, unless we see our object,
how shall we know how to place or prize it, in
our understanding, our imagination, our affections?
Yet it is not in itself, perhaps, a very high excellence;
but capable of being united indifferently with the
strongest, or with ordinary power.  Homer surpasses
all men in this quality: but strangely enough, at no
great distance below him are Richardson and Defoe.
It belongs, in truth, to what is called a lively mind;
and gives no sure indication of the higher endowments
that may exist along with it.  In all the three cases
we have mentioned, it is combined with great garrulity;
their descriptions are detailed, ample and lovingly
exact: Homer's fire bursts through, from time
to time, as if by accident; but Defoe and Richardson
have no fire.  Burns, again, is not more distinguished
by the clearness than by the impetuous force of his
conceptions.  Of the strength, the piercing emphasis
with which he thought, his emphasis of expression
may give a humble but the readiest proof.  Whoever
uttered sharper sayings than his; words more
memorable, now by their burning vehemence, now by
their cool vigor and laconic pith?  A single phrase
depicts a whole subject, a whole scene.  We hear of
"a gentleman that derived his patent of nobility direct
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
from Almighty God."  Our Scottish forefathers in
the battlefield struggled forward "<i>red-wat-shod</i>:"[<a id="chap01fn40text"></a><a href="#chap01fn40">40</a>]
in this one word a full vision of horror and carnage,
perhaps too frightfully accurate for Art!
</p>

<p>
In fact, one of the leading features in the mind of
Burns is this vigor of his strictly intellectual
perceptions.  A resolute force is ever visible in his
judgments, and in his feelings and volitions.  Professor
Stewart says of him, with some surprise:[<a id="chap01fn41text"></a><a href="#chap01fn41">41</a>] "All the
faculties of Burns's mind were, as far as I could
judge, equally vigorous; and his predilection for
poetry was rather the result of his own enthusiastic
and impassioned temper, than of a genius exclusively
adapted to that species of composition.  From his
conversation I should have pronounced him to be
fitted to excel in whatever walk of ambition he had
chosen to exert his abilities."  But this, if we
mistake not, is at all times the very essence of a truly
poetical endowment.  Poetry, except in such cases as
that of Keats, where the whole consists in a weak-eyed
maudlin sensibility, and a certain vague random
tunefulness of nature, is no separate faculty, no organ
which can be superadded to the rest, or disjoined
from them; but rather the result of their general
harmony and completion.[<a id="chap01fn42text"></a><a href="#chap01fn42">42</a>]  The feelings, the gifts
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
that exist in the Poet are those that exist, with more
or less development, in every human soul: the
imagination, which shudders at the Hell of Dante, is the
same faculty, weaker in degree, which called that
picture into being.  How does the Poet speak to
men, with power, but by being still more a man than
they?  Shakespeare, it has been well observed, in
the planning and completing of his tragedies, has
shown an understanding, were it nothing more, which
might have governed states, or indited a "Novum
Organum."  What Burns's force of understanding
may have been, we have less means of judging: it
had to dwell among the humblest objects; never saw
Philosophy; never rose, except by natural effort and
for short intervals, into the region of great ideas.
Nevertheless, sufficient indication, if no proof
sufficient, remains for us in his works: we discern the
brawny movements of a gigantic though untutored
strength; and can understand how, in conversation,
his quick sure insight into men and things may, as
much as aught else about him, have amazed the best
thinkers of his time and country.
</p>

<p>
But, unless we mistake, the intellectual gift of
Burns is fine as well as strong.  The more delicate
relations of things could not well have escaped his
eye, for they were intimately present to his heart.
The logic of the senate and the forum is indispensable,
but not all-sufficient; nay perhaps the highest Truth
is that which will the most certainly elude it.  For
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
this logic works by words, and "the highest," it has
been said, "cannot be expressed in words."  We are
not without tokens of an openness for this higher
truth also, of a keen though uncultivated sense for
it, having existed in Burns.  Mr. Stewart, it will be
remembered, "wonders," in the passage above quoted,
that Burns had formed some distinct conception of
the "doctrine of association."  We rather think that
far subtler things than the doctrine of association
had from of old been familiar to him.  Here for
instance:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We know nothing," thus writes he, "or next to
nothing, of the structure of our souls, so we cannot
account for those seeming caprices in them, that one
should be particularly pleased with this thing, or
struck with that, which, on minds of a different cast,
makes no extraordinary impression.  I have some
favorite flowers in spring, among which are the
mountain-daisy, the harebell, the foxglove, the wild-brier
rose, the budding birch, and the hoary hawthorn, that
I view and hang over with particular delight.  I
never hear the loud solitary whistle of the curlew
in a summer noon, or the wild mixing cadence of a
troop of gray plover in an autumnal morning, without
feeling an elevation of soul like the enthusiasm
of devotion or poetry.  Tell me, my dear friend, to
what can this be owing?  Are we a piece of machinery,
which, like the Æolian harp, passive, takes the
impression of the passing accident; or do these
workings argue something within us above the trodden
clod?  I own myself partial to such proofs of those
awful and important realities: a God that made
all things, man's immaterial and immortal nature,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
and a world of weal or woe beyond death and the
grave."[<a id="chap01fn43text"></a><a href="#chap01fn43">43</a>]
</p>

<p>
Force and fineness of understanding are often
spoken of as something different from general force
and fineness of nature, as something partly independent
of them.  The necessities of language so require
it; but in truth these qualities are not distinct and
independent: except in special cases, and from special
causes, they ever go together.  A man of strong
understanding is generally a man of strong character;
neither is delicacy in the one kind often divided from
delicacy in the other.  No one, at all events, is
ignorant that in the Poetry of Burns keenness of insight
keeps pace with keenness of feeling; that his <i>light</i>
is not more pervading than his <i>warmth</i>.  He is a
man of the most impassioned temper; with passions
not strong only, but noble, and of the sort in which
great virtues and great poems take their rise.  It is
reverence, it is love towards all Nature that inspires
him, that opens his eyes to its beauty, and makes
heart and voice eloquent in its praise.  There is a
true old saying, that "Love furthers knowledge:"
but above all, it is the living essence of that
knowledge which makes poets; the first principle of its
existence, increase, activity.  Of Burns's fervid
affection, his generous all-embracing Love, we have spoken
already, as of the grand distinction of his nature,
seen equally in word and deed, in his Life and in his
Writings.  It were easy to multiply examples.  Not
man only, but all that environs man in the material
and moral universe, is lovely in his sight: "the hoary
hawthorn," the "troop of gray plover," the "solitary
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
curlew," all are dear to him; all live in this Earth
along with him, and to all he is knit as in mysterious
brotherhood.  How touching is it, for instance, that,
amidst the gloom of personal misery, brooding over
the wintry desolation without him and within him,
he thinks of the "ourie cattle" and "silly sheep," and
their sufferings in the pitiless storm!
</p>

The tenant of the mean hut, with its "ragged roof

This is worth several homilies on Mercy; for it is
the voice of Mercy herself.  Burns, indeed, lives in
sympathy; his soul rushes forth into all realms of
being; nothing that has existence can be indifferent
to him.  The very Devil he cannot hate with right
orthodoxy:&mdash;

"He is the father of curses and lies," said Dr. Slop;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
"and is cursed and damned already."&mdash;"I am sorry
for it," quoth my uncle Toby![<a id="chap01fn48text"></a><a href="#chap01fn48">48</a>]&mdash;a Poet without
Love were a physical and metaphysical impossibility.
</p>

<p>
But[<a id="chap01fn49text"></a><a href="#chap01fn49">49</a>] has it not been said, in contradiction to this
principle, that "Indignation makes verses"?[<a id="chap01fn50text"></a><a href="#chap01fn50">50</a>]  It has
been so said, and is true enough: but the contradiction
is apparent, not real.  The Indignation which
makes verses is, properly speaking, an inverted Love;
the love of some right, some worth, some goodness,
belonging to ourselves or others, which has been
injured, and which this tempestuous feeling issues forth
to defend and avenge.  No selfish fury of heart,
existing there as a primary feeling, and without its
opposite, ever produced much Poetry: otherwise, we
suppose, the Tiger were the most musical of all our
choristers.  Johnson said, he loved a good hater; by
which he must have meant, not so much one that
hated violently, as one that hated wisely; hated
baseness from love of nobleness.  However, in spite of
Johnson's paradox, tolerable enough for once in
speech, but which need not have been so often adopted
in print since then, we rather believe that good men
deal sparingly in hatred, either wise or unwise: nay
that a "good" hater is still a desideratum in this
world.  The Devil, at least, who passes for the chief
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
and best of that class, is said to be nowise an amiable
character.[<a id="chap01fn51text"></a><a href="#chap01fn51">51</a>]
</p>

<p>
Of the verses which Indignation makes, Burns has
also given us specimens: and among the best that
were ever given.  Who will forget his "Dweller in
yon Dungeon dark;" a piece that might have been
chanted by the Furies of Æschylus?  The secrets of
the infernal Pit are laid bare; a boundless baleful
"darkness visible;"[<a id="chap01fn52text"></a><a href="#chap01fn52">52</a>] and streaks of hell-fire quivering
madly in its black haggard bosom!
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Dweller in yon Dungeon dark,<br>
  Hangman of Creation, mark!<br>
  Who in widow's weeds appears,<br>
  Laden with unhonoured years,<br>
  Noosing with care a bursting purse,<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Why should we speak of "Scots wha hae wi' Wallace
bled;" since all know of it, from the king to
the meanest of his subjects?  This dithyrambic was
composed on horseback; in riding in the middle of
tempests, over the wildest Galloway moor, in
company with a Mr. Syme, who, observing the poet's
looks, forbore to speak,&mdash;judiciously enough, for a
man composing "Bruce's Address" might be unsafe
to trifle with.  Doubtless this stern hymn was singing
itself, as he formed it, through the soul of Burns; but
to the external ear, it should be sung with the throat
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
of the whirlwind.[<a id="chap01fn54text"></a><a href="#chap01fn54">54</a>]  So long as there is warm blood in
the heart of Scotchman or man, it will move in fierce
thrills under this war-ode; the best, we believe, that
was ever written by any pen.
</p>

<p>
Another wild stormful Song, that dwells in our ear
and mind with a strange tenacity, is "Macpherson's
Farewell."  Perhaps there is something in the tradition
itself that cooperates.  For was not this grim
Celt, this shaggy Northland Cacus,[<a id="chap01fn55text"></a><a href="#chap01fn55">55</a>] that "lived a
life of sturt and strife, and died by treacherie,"&mdash;was
not he too one of the Nimrods and Napoleons of
the earth, in the arena of his own remote misty glens,
for want of a clearer and wider one?  Nay, was there
not a touch of grace given him?  A fibre of love and
softness, of poetry itself, must have lived in his
savage heart: for he composed that air the night before
his execution; on the wings of that poor melody his
better soul would soar away above oblivion, pain and
all the ignominy and despair, which, like an
avalanche, was hurling him to the abyss!  Here also, as
at Thebes, and in Pelops' line,[<a id="chap01fn56text"></a><a href="#chap01fn56">56</a>] was material Fate
matched against man's Free-will; matched in bitterest
though obscure duel; and the ethereal soul sank
not, even in its blindness, without a cry which has
survived it.  But who, except Burns, could have
given words to such a soul; words that we never
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P36"></a>36}</span>
listen to without a strange half-barbarous, half-poetic
fellow-feeling?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sae rantingly, sae wantonly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sae dauntingly gaed he;<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Under a lighter disguise, the same principle of
Love, which we have recognized as the great characteristic
of Burns, and of all true poets, occasionally
manifests itself in the shape of Humor.  Everywhere,
indeed, in his sunny moods, a full buoyant flood of
mirth rolls through the mind of Burns; he rises to
the high, and stoops to the low, and is brother and
playmate to all Nature.  We speak not of his bold
and often irresistible faculty of caricature; for this
is Drollery rather than Humor: but a much tenderer
sportfulness dwells in him; and comes forth here and
there, in evanescent and beautiful touches; as in his
"Address to the Mouse," or the "Farmer's Mare,"
or in his "Elegy on poor Mailie," which last may be
reckoned his happiest effort of this kind.  In these
pieces there are traits of a Humor as fine as that of
Sterne;[<a id="chap01fn57text"></a><a href="#chap01fn57">57</a>] yet altogether different, original,
peculiar,&mdash;the Humor of Burns.
</p>

<p>
Of the tenderness, the playful pathos, and many
other kindred qualities of Burns's Poetry, much more
might be said; but now, with these poor outlines of
a sketch, we must prepare to quit this part of our
subject.  To speak of his individual Writings,
adequately and with any detail, would lead us far
beyond our limits.  As already hinted, we can look on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
but few of these pieces as, in strict critical language,
deserving the name of Poems: they are rhymed
eloquence, rhymed pathos, rhymed sense; yet seldom
essentially melodious, aerial, poetical.  "Tam o'
Shanter" itself, which enjoys so high a favor, does
not appear to us at all decisively to come under this
last category.  It is not so much a poem, as a piece
of sparkling rhetoric; the heart and body of the story
still lies hard and dead.  He has not gone back, much
less carried us back, into that dark, earnest,
wondering age, when the tradition was believed, and when
it took its rise; he does not attempt, by any
new-modelling of his supernatural ware, to strike anew
that deep mysterious chord of human nature, which
once responded to such things; and which lives in us
too, and will forever live, though silent now, or
vibrating with far other notes, and to far different issues.
Our German readers will understand us, when we
say, that he is not the Tieck but the Musäus of this
tale.[<a id="chap01fn58text"></a><a href="#chap01fn58">58</a>]  Externally it is all green and living; yet look
closer, it is no firm growth, but only ivy on a rock.
The piece does not properly cohere: the strange chasm
which yawns in our incredulous imaginations between
the Ayr publichouse and the gate of Tophet, is
nowhere bridged over, nay the idea of such a bridge is
laughed at; and thus the Tragedy of the adventure
becomes a mere drunken phantasmagoria, or many-colored
spectrum painted on ale-vapors, and the Farce
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
alone has any reality.  We do not say that Burns
should have made much more of this tradition; we
rather think that, for strictly poetical purposes, not
much was to be made of it.  Neither are we blind
to the deep, varied, genial power displayed in what
he has actually accomplished; but we find far more
"Shakespearean" qualities, as these of "Tam o'
Shanter" have been fondly named, in many of his
other pieces; nay we incline to believe that this latter
might have been written, all but quite as well, by a
man who, in place of genius, had only possessed talent.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we may venture to say, that the most
strictly poetical of all his "poems" is one which does
not appear in Currie's Edition; but has been often
printed before and since, under the humble title of
"The Jolly Beggars."  The subject truly is among
the lowest in Nature; but it only the more shows our
Poet's gift in raising it into the domain of Art.  To
our minds, this piece seems thoroughly compacted;
melted together, refined; and poured forth in one
flood of true <i>liquid</i> harmony.  It is light, airy, soft
of movement; yet sharp and precise in its details;
every face is a portrait: that <i>raucle carlin</i>,[<a id="chap01fn59text"></a><a href="#chap01fn59">59</a>] that <i>wee
Apollo</i>, that <i>Son of Mars</i>, are Scottish, yet ideal;
the scene is at once a dream, and the very Ragcastle
of "Poosie-Nansie."[<a id="chap01fn60text"></a><a href="#chap01fn60">60</a>]  Farther, it seems in a
considerable degree complete, a real self-supporting Whole,
which is the highest merit in a poem.  The blanket
of the Night is drawn asunder for a moment; in full,
ruddy, flaming light, these rough tatterdemalions are
seen in their boisterous revel; for the strong pulse of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
Life vindicates its right to gladness even here; and
when the curtain closes, we prolong the action,
without effort; the next day as the last, our <i>Caird</i> and
our <i>Balladmonger</i> are singing and soldiering; their
"brats and callets" are hawking, begging, cheating;
and some other night, in new combinations, they will
wring from Fate another hour of wassail and good
cheer.  Apart from the universal sympathy with man
which this again bespeaks in Burns, a genuine inspiration
and no inconsiderable technical talent are manifested
here.  There is the fidelity, humor, warm life
and accurate painting and grouping of some Teniers,[<a id="chap01fn61text"></a><a href="#chap01fn61">61</a>]
for whom hostlers and carousing peasants are not
without significance.  It would be strange, doubtless,
to call this the best of Burns's writings: we mean
to say only, that it seems to us the most perfect of
its kind, as a piece of poetical composition, strictly
so called.  In "The Beggar's Opera,"[<a id="chap01fn62text"></a><a href="#chap01fn62">62</a>] in the "Beggar's
Bush,"[<a id="chap01fn63text"></a><a href="#chap01fn63">63</a>] as other critics[<a id="chap01fn64text"></a><a href="#chap01fn64">64</a>] have already remarked,
there is nothing which, in real poetic vigor, equals
this <i>Cantata</i>; nothing, as we think, which comes
within many degrees of it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But by far the most finished, complete and truly
inspired pieces of Burns are, without dispute, to be
found among his "Songs."  It is here that, although
through a small aperture, his light shines with least
obstruction; in its highest beauty and pure sunny
clearness.  The reason may be, that Song is a brief
simple species of composition; and requires nothing
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
so much for its perfection as genuine poetic feeling,
genuine music of heart.  Yet the Song has its rules
equally with the Tragedy; rules which in most cases
are poorly fulfilled, in many cases are not so much as
felt.  We might write a long essay on the Songs of
Burns; which we reckon by far the best that Britain
has yet produced: for indeed, since the era of Queen
Elizabeth, we know not that, by any other hand,
aught truly worth attention has been accomplished in
this department.  True, we have songs enough "by
persons of quality;" we have tawdry, hollow, wine-bred
madrigals; many a rhymed speech "in the flowing
and watery vein of Osorius the Portugal Bishop,"[<a id="chap01fn65text"></a><a href="#chap01fn65">65</a>]
rich in sonorous words, and, for moral, dashed
perhaps with some tint of a sentimental sensuality; all
which many persons cease not from endeavoring to
sing; though for most part, we fear, the music is but
from the throat outwards, or at best from some region
far enough short of the <i>Soul</i>; not in which, but in
a certain inane Limbo of the Fancy, or even in some
vaporous debatable-land on the outskirts of the
Nervous System, most of such madrigals and rhymed
speeches seem to have originated.
</p>

<p>
With the Songs of Burns we must not name these
things.  Independently of the clear, manly, heartfelt
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
sentiment that ever pervades <i>his</i> poetry, his Songs
are honest in another point of view: in form, as well
as in spirit.  They do not <i>affect</i> to be set to music,
but they actually and in themselves are music; they
have received their life, and fashioned themselves
together, in the medium of Harmony, as Venus rose
from the bosom of the sea.  The story, the feeling, is
not detailed, but suggested; not <i>said</i>, or spouted, in
rhetorical completeness and coherence; but <i>sung</i>, in
fitful gushes, in glowing hints, in fantastic breaks,
in <i>warblings</i> not of the voice only, but of the whole
mind.  We consider this to be the essence of a song;
and that no songs since the little careless catches, and
as it were drops of song, which Shakespeare has here
and there sprinkled over his Plays, fulfil this
condition in nearly the same degree as most of Burns's do.
Such grace and truth of external movement, too,
presupposes in general a corresponding force and truth
of sentiment and inward meaning.  The Songs of
Burns are not more perfect in the former quality than
in the latter.  With what tenderness he sings, yet
with what vehemence and entireness!  There is a
piercing wail in his sorrow, the purest rapture in his
joy; he burns with the sternest ire, or laughs with
the loudest or sliest mirth; and yet he is sweet and
soft, "sweet as the smile when fond lovers meet, and
soft as their parting tear."  If we further take into
account the immense variety of his subjects; how,
from the loud flowing revel in "Willie brew'd a Peck
o' Maut," to the still, rapt enthusiasm of sadness of
"Mary in Heaven;" from the glad kind greeting of
"Auld Lang Syne," or the comic archness of "Duncan Gray,"
to the fire-eyed fury of "Scots wha hae
wi' Wallace bled," he has found a tone and words for
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
every mood of man's heart,&mdash;it will seem a small
praise if we rank him as the first of all our
Song-writers; for we know not where to find one worthy of
being second to him.
</p>

<p>
It is on his Songs, as we believe, that Burns's
chief influence as an author will ultimately be found
to depend: nor, if our Fletcher's[<a id="chap01fn66text"></a><a href="#chap01fn66">66</a>] aphorism is true,
shall we account this a small influence.  "Let me
make the songs of a people," said he, "and you
shall make its laws."  Surely, if ever any Poet might
have equalled himself with Legislators on this ground,
it was Burns.  His Songs are already part of the
mother-tongue, not of Scotland only, but of Britain,
and of the millions that in all ends of the earth speak
a British language.  In hut and hall, as the heart
unfolds itself in many-colored joy and woe of existence,
the <i>name</i>, the <i>voice</i> of that joy and that woe,
is the name and voice which Burns has given them.
Strictly speaking, perhaps no British man has so
deeply affected the thoughts and feelings of so many
men, as this solitary and altogether private
individual, with means apparently the humblest.
</p>

<p>
In another point of view, moreover, we incline to
think that Burns's influence may have been considerable:
we mean, as exerted specially on the Literature
of his country, at least on the Literature of Scotland.
Among the great changes which British, particularly
Scottish literature, has undergone since that period,
one of the greatest will be found to consist in its
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
remarkable increase of nationality.  Even the English
writers most popular in Burns's time were little
distinguished for their literary patriotism, in this its
best sense.  A certain attenuated cosmopolitanism
had, in good measure, taken place of the old insular
home-feeling; literature was, as it were, without any
local environment; was not nourished by the affections
which spring from a native soil.  Our Grays
and Glovers[<a id="chap01fn67text"></a><a href="#chap01fn67">67</a>] seemed to write almost as if <i>in vacuo</i>;
the thing written bears no mark of place; it is not
written so much for Englishmen, as for men; or
rather, which is the inevitable result of this, for
certain Generalizations which philosophy termed men.
Goldsmith is an exception: not so Johnson; the scene
of his "Rambler" is little more English than that of
his "Rasselas."
</p>

<p>
But if such was, in some degree, the case with
England, it was, in the highest degree, the case with
Scotland.  In fact our Scottish literature had, at that
period, a very singular aspect; unexampled, so far as
we know, except perhaps at Geneva, where the same
state of matters appears still to continue.  For a long
period after Scotland became British, we had no
literature; at the date when Addison and Steele were
writing their "Spectators," our good John Boston
was writing, with the noblest intent, but alike in
defiance of grammar and philosophy, his "Fourfold State
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
of Man."[<a id="chap01fn68text"></a><a href="#chap01fn68">68</a>]  Then came the schisms in our National
Church, and the fiercer schisms in our Body Politic:
Theologic ink, and Jacobite blood, with gall enough
in both cases, seemed to have blotted out the intellect
of the country: however, it was only obscured, not
obliterated.  Lord Kames made nearly the first
attempt at writing English; and ere long, Hume,
Robertson, Smith, and a whole host of followers, attracted
hither the eyes of all Europe.  And yet in this
brilliant resuscitation of our "fervid genius," there was
nothing truly Scottish, nothing indigenous; except,
perhaps, the natural impetuosity of intellect, which
we sometimes claim, and are sometimes upbraided
with, as a characteristic of our nation.  It is curious
to remark that Scotland, so full of writers, had no
Scottish culture, nor indeed any English; our
culture was almost exclusively French.  It was by
studying Racine and Voltaire, Batteux and Boileau, that
Kames had trained himself to be a critic and
philosopher; it was the light of Montesquieu and Mably
that guided Robertson in his political speculations;
Quesnay's lamp that kindled the lamp of Adam
Smith.[<a id="chap01fn69text"></a><a href="#chap01fn69">69</a>]  Hume was too rich a man to borrow; and
perhaps he reacted on the French more than he was
acted on by them; but neither had he aught to do
with Scotland; Edinburgh, equally with La Fleche,[<a id="chap01fn70text"></a><a href="#chap01fn70">70</a>]
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
was but the lodging and laboratory, in which he not
so much morally <i>lived</i>, as metaphysically <i>investigated</i>.
Never, perhaps, was there a class of writers so clear
and well-ordered, yet so totally destitute, to all
appearance, of any patriotic affection, nay of any human
affection whatever.  The French wits of the period
were as unpatriotic: but their general deficiency in
moral principle, not to say their avowed sensuality
and unbelief in all virtue, strictly so called, render
this accountable enough.  We hope there is a
patriotism founded on something better than prejudice;
that our country may be dear to us, without injury
to our philosophy; that in loving and justly prizing
all other lands, we may prize justly, and yet love
before all others, our own stern Motherland, and the
venerable Structure of social and moral Life, which
Mind has through long ages been building up for us
there.  Surely there is nourishment for the better
part of man's heart in all this: surely the roots, that
have fixed themselves in the very core of man's being,
may be so cultivated as to grow up not into briers,
but into roses, in the field of his life!  Our Scottish
sages have no such propensities: the field of their
life shows neither briers nor roses; but only a flat,
continuous thrashing-floor for Logic, whereon all
questions, from the "Doctrine of Kent" to the
"Natural History of Religion," are thrashed and sifted
with the same mechanical impartiality![<a id="chap01fn71text"></a><a href="#chap01fn71">71</a>]
</p>

<p>
With Sir Walter Scott at the head of our literature,
it cannot be denied that much of this evil is
past, or rapidly passing away: our chief literary men,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P46"></a>46}</span>
whatever other faults they may have, no longer live
among us like a French Colony, or some knot of
Propaganda Missionaries; but like natural-born
subjects of the soil, partaking and sympathizing in all
our attachments, humors, and habits.  Our literature
no longer grows in water but in mould, and with the
true racy virtues of the soil and climate.  How much
of this change may be due to Burns, or to any other
individual, it might be difficult to estimate.[<a id="chap01fn72text"></a><a href="#chap01fn72">72</a>]  Direct
literary imitation of Burns was not to be looked for.
But his example, in the fearless adoption of domestic
subjects, could not but operate from afar; and
certainly in no heart did the love of country ever burn
with a warmer glow than in that of Burns: "a tide
of Scottish prejudice,"[<a id="chap01fn73text"></a><a href="#chap01fn73">73</a>] as he modestly calls this deep
and generous feeling, "had been poured along his
veins; and he felt that it would boil there till the
flood-gates shut in eternal rest."  It seemed to him,
as if <i>he</i> could do so little for his country, and yet
would so gladly have done all.  One small province
stood open for him,&mdash;that of Scottish Song; and
how eagerly he entered on it, how devotedly he
labored there!  In his toilsome journeyings, this object
never quits him; it is the little happy-valley of his
careworn heart.  In the gloom of his own affliction,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
he eagerly searches after some lonely brother of the
muse, and rejoices to snatch one other name from the
oblivion that was covering it![<a id="chap01fn74text"></a><a href="#chap01fn74">74</a>]  These were early
feelings, and they abode with him to the end:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ... A wish (I mind its power),<br>
  A wish, that to my latest hour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will strongly heave my breast,&mdash;<br>
  That I, for poor auld Scotland's sake,<br>
  Some useful plan or book could make,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sing a sang at least.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The rough bur Thistle spreading wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amang the bearded bear,<br>
  I turn'd my weeding-clips aside,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spared the symbol dear.[<a id="chap01fn75text"></a><a href="#chap01fn75">75</a>]<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But to leave the mere literary character of Burns,
which has already detained us too long.  Far more
interesting than any of his written works, as it
appears to us, are his acted ones: the Life he willed
and was fated to lead among his fellow-men.  These
Poems are but like little rhymed fragments scattered
here and there in the grand unrhymed Romance of
his earthly existence; and it is only when intercalated
in this at their proper places, that they attain their
full measure of significance.  And this too, alas! was
but a fragment!  The plan of a mighty edifice
had been sketched; some columns, porticos, firm
masses of building, stand completed; the rest more
or less clearly indicated; with many a far-stretching
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
tendency, which only studious and friendly eyes can
now trace towards the purposed termination.  For
the work is broken off in the middle, almost in the
beginning; and rises among us, beautiful and sad, at
once unfinished and a ruin!  If charitable judgment
was necessary in estimating his Poems, and justice
required that the aim and the manifest power to fulfil
it must often be accepted for the fulfilment; much
more is this the case in regard to his Life, the sum
and result of all his endeavors, where his difficulties
came upon him not in detail only, but in mass; and
so much has been left unaccomplished, nay was
mistaken, and altogether marred.
</p>

<p>
Properly speaking, there is but one era in the life
of Burns, and that the earliest.  We have not youth
and manhood, but only youth: for, to the end, we
discern no decisive change in the complexion of his
character; in his thirty-seventh year, he is still, as it
were, in youth.  With all that resoluteness of judgment,
that penetrating insight, and singular maturity
of intellectual power, exhibited in his writings, he
never attains to any clearness regarding himself: to
the last, he never ascertains his peculiar aim, even
with such distinctness as is common among ordinary
men; and therefore never can pursue it with that
singleness of will which insures success and some
contentment to such men.[<a id="chap01fn76text"></a><a href="#chap01fn76">76</a>]  To the last, he wavers
between two purposes: glorying in his talent, like a
true poet, he yet cannot consent to make this his chief
and sole glory, and to follow it as the one thing
needful, through poverty or riches, through good or evil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
report.[<a id="chap01fn77text"></a><a href="#chap01fn77">77</a>]  Another far meaner ambition still cleaves to
him; he must dream and struggle about a certain
"Rock of Independence;" which, natural and even
admirable as it might be, was still but a warring with
the world, on the comparatively insignificant ground
of his being more completely or less completely
supplied with money than others; of his standing at a
higher or at a lower altitude in general estimation
than others.  For the world still appears to him, as
to the young, in borrowed colors; he expects from it
what it cannot give to any man; seeks for contentment,
not within himself, in action and wise effort,
but from without, in the kindness of circumstances,
in love, friendship, honor, pecuniary ease.  He would
be happy, not actively and in himself, but passively
and from some ideal cornucopia of Enjoyments, not
earned by his own labor, but showered on him by the
beneficence of Destiny.  Thus, like a young man, he
cannot gird himself up for any worthy well-calculated
goal, but swerves to and fro, between passionate hope
and remorseful disappointment: rushing onwards
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
with a deep tempestuous force, he surmounts or
breaks asunder many a barrier; travels, nay advances
far, but advancing only under uncertain guidance, is
ever and anon turned from his path; and to the last
cannot reach the only true happiness of a man, that
of clear decided Activity in the sphere for which, by
nature and circumstances, he has been fitted and
appointed.
</p>

<p>
We do not say these things in dispraise of Burns;
nay, perhaps, they but interest us the more in his
favor.  This blessing is not given soonest to the best;
but rather, it is often the greatest minds that are
latest in obtaining it; for where most is to be
developed, most time may be required to develop it.  A
complex condition had been assigned him from
without; as complex a condition from within: no
"pre-established harmony" existed between the clay soil
of Mossgiel and the empyrean soul of Robert Burns;
it was not wonderful that the adjustment between
them should have been long postponed, and his arm
long cumbered, and his sight confused, in so vast and
discordant an economy as he had been appointed
steward over.  Byron was, at his death, but a year
younger than Burns; and through life, as it might
have appeared, far more simply situated: yet in him
too we can trace no such adjustment, no such moral
manhood; but at best, and only a little before his
end, the beginning of what seemed such.
</p>

<p>
By much the most striking incident in Burns's
Life is his journey to Edinburgh; but perhaps a still
more important one is his residence at Irvine so early
as in his twenty-third year.  Hitherto his life had been
poor and toilworn; but otherwise not ungenial, and,
with all its distresses, by no means unhappy.  In his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P51"></a>51}</span>
parentage, deducting outward circumstances, he had
every reason to reckon himself fortunate.  His father
was a man of thoughtful, intense, earnest character,
as the best of our peasants are; valuing knowledge,
possessing some, and, what is far better and rarer,
openminded for more: a man with a keen insight
and devout heart; reverent towards God, friendly
therefore, at once, and fearless towards all that God
has made: in one word, though but a hard-handed
peasant, a complete and fully unfolded <i>Man</i>.  Such a
father is seldom found in any rank in society; and
was worth descending far in society to seek.[<a id="chap01fn78text"></a><a href="#chap01fn78">78</a>]  Unfortunately
he was very poor; had he been even a little
richer, almost never so little, the whole might have
issued far otherwise.  Mighty events turn on a straw;
the crossing of a brook decides the conquest of the
world.  Had this William Burns's small seven acres
of nursery-ground anywise prospered, the boy Robert
had been sent to school; had struggled forward, as
so many weaker men do, to some university; come
forth not as a rustic wonder, but as a regular
well-trained intellectual workman, and changed the whole
course of British Literature,&mdash;for it lay in him to
have done this![<a id="chap01fn79text"></a><a href="#chap01fn79">79</a>]  But the nursery did not prosper;
poverty sank his whole family below the help of even
our cheap school-system: Burns remained a hard-worked
ploughboy, and British literature took its
own course.  Nevertheless, even in this rugged scene
there is much to nourish him.  If he drudges, it is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P52"></a>52}</span>
with his brother, and for his father and mother, whom
he loves, and would fain shield from want.  Wisdom
is not banished from their poor hearth, nor the
balm of natural feeling: the solemn words, "Let us
worship God," are heard there from a "priest-like
father;"[<a id="chap01fn80text"></a><a href="#chap01fn80">80</a>] if threatenings of unjust men throw mother
and children into tears, these are tears not of grief
only, but of holiest affection; every heart in that
humble group feels itself the closer knit to every
other; in their hard warfare they are there together,
a "little band of brethren."  Neither are such tears,
and the deep beauty that dwells in them, their only
portion.  Light visits the hearts as it does the eyes
of all living: there is a force, too, in this youth, that
enables him to trample on misfortune; nay to bind it
under his feet to make him sport.  For a bold, warm,
buoyant humor of character has been given him; and
so the thick-coming shapes of evil are welcomed with
a gay, friendly irony, and in their closest pressure he
bates no jot of heart or hope.  Vague yearnings of
ambition fail not, as he grows up; dreamy fancies
hang like cloud-cities around him; the curtain of
Existence is slowly rising, in many-colored splendor
and gloom: and the auroral light of first love is
gilding his horizon, and the music of song is on his path;
and so he walks
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... "in glory and in joy,<br>
  Behind his plough, upon the mountain side."[<a id="chap01fn81text"></a><a href="#chap01fn81">81</a>]<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
We ourselves know, from the best evidence, that
up to this date Burns was happy; nay that he was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
the gayest, brightest, most fantastic, fascinating being
to be found in the world; more so even than he ever
afterwards appeared.[<a id="chap01fn82text"></a><a href="#chap01fn82">82</a>]  But now, at this early age, he
quits the paternal roof; goes forth into looser, louder,
more exciting society; and becomes initiated in those
dissipations, those vices, which a certain class of
philosophers have asserted to be a natural preparative
for entering on active life: a kind of mud-bath, in
which the youth is, as it were, necessitated to steep,
and, we suppose, cleanse himself, before the real toga
of Manhood can be laid on him.  We shall not
dispute much with this class of philosophers; we hope
they are mistaken: for Sin and Remorse so easily
beset us at all stages of life, and are always such
indifferent company, that it seems hard we should, at
any stage, be forced and fated not only to meet but
to yield to them, and even serve for a term in their
leprous armada.  We hope it is not so.  Clear we
are, at all events, it cannot be the training one
receives in this Devil's service, but only our
determining to desert from it, that fits us for true manly
Action.  We become men, not after we have been
dissipated, and disappointed in the chase of false
pleasure; but after we have ascertained, in any way,
what impassable barriers hem us in through this life;
how mad it is to hope for contentment to our infinite
soul from the <i>gifts</i> of this extremely finite world;
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
that a man must be sufficient for himself; and that
for suffering and enduring there is no remedy but
striving and doing.  Manhood begins when we have
in any way made truce with necessity; begins even
when we have surrendered to necessity, as the most
part only do; but begins joyfully and hopefully only
when we have reconciled ourselves to Necessity; and
thus, in reality, triumphed over it, and felt that in
Necessity we are free.  Surely such lessons as this
last, which, in one shape or other, is the grand lesson
for every mortal man, are better learned from the
lips of a devout mother, in the looks and actions of
a devout father, while the heart is yet soft and pliant,
than in collision with the sharp adamant of Fate,
attracting us to shipwreck us, when the heart is
grown hard, and may be broken before it will become
contrite.  Had Burns continued to learn this, as he
was already learning it, in his father's cottage, he
would have learned it fully, which he never did; and
been saved many a lasting aberration, many a bitter
hour and year of remorseful sorrow.
</p>

<p>
It seems to us another circumstance of fatal import
in Burns's history, that at this time too he became
involved in the religious quarrels of his district; that
he was enlisted and feasted, as the fighting man of
the New-Light Priesthood, in their highly unprofitable
warfare.  At the tables of these freeminded
clergy he learned much more than was needful for
him.  Such liberal ridicule of fanaticism awakened in
his mind scruples about Religion itself; and a whole
world of Doubts, which it required quite another set
of conjurers than these men to exorcise.  We do not
say that such an intellect as his could have escaped
similar doubts at some period of his history; or even
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
that he could, at a later period, have come through
them altogether victorious and unharmed: but it
seems peculiarly unfortunate that this time, above all
others, should have been fixed for the encounter.
For now, with principles assailed by evil example
from without, by "passions raging like demons"[<a id="chap01fn83atext"></a><a href="#chap01fn83a">83a</a>] from
within, he had little need of sceptical misgivings to
whisper treason in the heat of the battle, or to cut
off his retreat if he were already defeated.  He loses
his feeling of innocence; his mind is at variance with
itself; the old divinity no longer presides there; but
wild Desires and wild Repentance alternately oppress
him.  Ere long, too, he has committed himself before
the world; his character for sobriety, dear to a Scottish
peasant as few corrupted worldlings can even conceive,
is destroyed in the eyes of men; and his only
refuge consists in trying to disbelieve his guiltiness,
and is but a refuge of lies.  The blackest desperation
now gathers over him, broken only by red lightnings
of remorse.  The whole fabric of his life is blasted
asunder; for now not only his character, but his personal
liberty is to be lost; men and Fortune are leagued
for his hurt; "hungry Ruin has him in the wind."  He
sees no escape but the saddest of all: exile from
his loved country, to a country in every sense
inhospitable and abhorrent to him.  While the "gloomy
night is gathering fast,"[<a id="chap01fn83btext"></a><a href="#chap01fn83b">83b</a>] in mental storm and solitude,
as well as in physical, he sings his wild farewell
to Scotland:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Farewell, my friends; farewell, my foes!<br>
  My peace with these, my love with those:<br>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
  The bursting tears my heart declare;<br>
  Adieu, my native banks of Ayr![<a id="chap01fn84text"></a><a href="#chap01fn84">84</a>]<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Light breaks suddenly in on him in floods; but
still a false transitory light, and no real sunshine.
He is invited to Edinburgh; hastens thither with
anticipating heart; is welcomed as in a triumph, and with
universal blandishment and acclamation; whatever is
wisest, whatever is greatest or loveliest there, gathers
round him, to gaze on his face, to show him honor,
sympathy, affection.  Burns's appearance among the
sages and nobles of Edinburgh must be regarded as
one of the most singular phenomena in modern
Literature; almost like the appearance of some
Napoleon among the crowned sovereigns of modern
Politics.  For it is nowise as "a mockery king,"[<a id="chap01fn85text"></a><a href="#chap01fn85">85</a>] set
there by favor, transiently and for a purpose, that
he will let himself be treated, still less is he a mad
Rienzi, whose sudden elevation turns his too weak
head: but he stands there on his own basis; cool,
unastonished, holding his equal rank from Nature
herself; putting forth no claim which there is not
strength in him, as well as about him to vindicate.
Mr. Lockhart has some forcible observations on this
point:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It needs no effort of imagination," says he, "to
conceive what the sensations of an isolated set of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
scholars (almost all either clergymen or professors)
must have been in the presence of this big-boned,
black-browed, brawny stranger, with his great
flashing eyes, who, having forced his way among them
from the plough-tail at a single stride, manifested in
the whole strain of his bearing and conversation a
most thorough conviction, that in the society of the
most eminent men of his nation he was exactly where
he was entitled to be; hardly deigned to flatter them
by exhibiting even an occasional symptom of being
flattered by their notice; by turns calmly measured
himself against the most cultivated understandings
of his time in discussion; overpowered the <i>bon-mots</i>
of the most celebrated convivialists by broad floods of
merriment, impregnated with all the burning life of
genius; astounded bosoms habitually enveloped in the
thrice-piled folds of social reserve, by compelling
them to tremble,&mdash;nay to tremble visibly,&mdash;beneath
the fearless touch of natural pathos; and all this
without indicating the smallest willingness to be ranked
among those professional ministers of excitement,
who are content to be paid in money and smiles for
doing what the spectators and auditors would be
ashamed of doing in their own persons, even if they
had the power of doing it; and last, and probably
worst of all, who was known to be in the habit of
enlivening societies which they would have scorned
to approach, still more frequently than their own,
with eloquence no less magnificent; with wit, in all
likelihood still more daring; often enough, as the
superiors whom he fronted without alarm might have
guessed from the beginning, and had ere long no
occasion to guess, with wit pointed at themselves."[<a id="chap01fn86text"></a><a href="#chap01fn86">86</a>]
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
</p>

<p>
The farther we remove from this scene, the more
singular will it seem to us: details of the exterior
aspect of it are already full of interest.  Most readers
recollect Mr. Walker's personal interviews with Burns
as among the best passages of his Narrative: a time
will come when this reminiscence of Sir Walter Scott's,
slight though it is, will also be precious:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"As for Burns," writes Sir Walter, "I may truly
say, <i>Virgilium vidi tantum</i>.[<a id="chap01fn87text"></a><a href="#chap01fn87">87</a>]  I was a lad of fifteen in
1786-87, when he came first to Edinburgh, but had
sense and feeling enough to be much interested in his
poetry, and would have given the world to know
him: but I had very little acquaintance with any
literary people, and still less with the gentry of the west
country, the two sets that he most frequented.
Mr. Thomas Grierson was at that time a clerk of my
father's.  He knew Burns, and promised to ask him
to his lodgings to dinner; but had no opportunity to
keep his word; otherwise I might have seen more of
this distinguished man.  As it was, I saw him one
day at the late venerable Professor Ferguson's,[<a id="chap01fn88text"></a><a href="#chap01fn88">88</a>] where
there were several gentlemen of literary reputation,
among whom I remember the celebrated Mr. Dugald
Stewart.  Of course, we youngsters sat silent, looked
and listened.  The only thing I remember which was
remarkable in Burns's manner, was the effect
produced upon him by a print of Bunbury's,[<a id="chap01fn89text"></a><a href="#chap01fn89">89</a>] representing
a soldier lying dead on the snow, his dog sitting
in misery on one side,&mdash;on the other, his widow,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
with a child in her arms.  These lines were written
beneath:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Cold on Canadian hills, or Minden's plain,<br>
  Perhaps that mother wept her soldier slain;<br>
  Bent o'er her babe, her eye dissolved in dew,<br>
  The big drops mingling with the milk he drew,<br>
  Gave the sad presage of his future years,<br>
  The child of misery baptised in tears.'<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Burns seemed much affected by the print, or
rather by the ideas which it suggested to his mind.
He actually shed tears.  He asked whose the lines
were; and it chanced that nobody but myself remembered
that they occur in a half-forgotten poem of
Langhorne's called by the unpromising title of 'The
Justice of Peace.'[<a id="chap01fn90text"></a><a href="#chap01fn90">90</a>]  I whispered my information to
a friend present; he mentioned it to Burns, who
rewarded me with a look and a word, which, though of
mere civility, I then received and still recollect with
very great pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"His person was strong and robust; his manners
rustic, not clownish; a sort of dignified plainness and
simplicity, which received part of its effect perhaps
from one's knowledge of his extraordinary talents.
His features are represented in Mr. Nasmyth's[<a id="chap01fn91text"></a><a href="#chap01fn91">91</a>]
picture: but to me it conveys the idea that they are
diminished, as if seen in perspective.  I think his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
countenance was more massive than it looks in any of
the portraits.  I should have taken the poet, had I
not known what he was, for a very sagacious country
farmer of the old Scotch school, <i>i.e.</i>, none of your
modern agriculturists who keep laborers for their
drudgery, but the <i>douce gudeman</i> who held his own
plough.  There was a strong expression of sense and
shrewdness in all his lineaments; the eye alone, I
think, indicated the poetical character and temperament.
It was large, and of a dark cast, which glowed
(I say literally <i>glowed</i>) when he spoke with feeling
or interest.  I never saw such another eye in a
human head, though I have seen the most distinguished
men of my time.  His conversation expressed perfect
self-confidence, without the slightest presumption.
Among the men who were the most learned of their
time and country, he expressed himself with perfect
firmness, but without the least intrusive forwardness:
and when he differed in opinion, he did not hesitate
to express it firmly, yet at the same time with
modesty.  I do not remember any part of his conversation
distinctly enough to be quoted; nor did I ever
see him again, except in the street, where he did
not recognize me, as I could not expect he should.
He was much caressed in Edinburgh: but (considering
what literary emoluments have been since his
day) the efforts made for his relief were extremely
trifling.
</p>

<p>
"I remember, on this occasion I mention, I thought
Burns's acquaintance with English poetry was rather
limited; and also that, having twenty times the
abilities of Allan Ramsay and of Ferguson, he talked of
them with too much humility as his models: there
was doubtless national predilection in his estimate,
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
</p>

<p>
"This is all I can tell you about Burns.  I have
only to add, that his dress corresponded with his
manner.  He was like a farmer dressed in his best
to dine with the laird.  I do not speak <i>in malam
partem</i>, when I say, I never saw a man in company
with his superiors in station or information more
perfectly free from either the reality or the affectation
of embarrassment.  I was told, but did not observe
it, that his address to females was extremely deferential,
and always with a turn either to the pathetic or
humorous, which engaged their attention particularly.
I have heard the late Duchess of Gordon remark
this.&mdash;I do not know anything I can add to these
recollections of forty years since."[<a id="chap01fn92text"></a><a href="#chap01fn92">92</a>]
</p>

<p>
The conduct of Burns under this dazzling blaze of
favor; the calm, unaffected, manly manner in which
he not only bore it, but estimated its value, has justly
been regarded as the best proof that could be given
of his real vigor and integrity of mind.  A little
natural vanity, some touches of hypocritical modesty,
some glimmerings of affectation, at least some fear
of being thought affected, we could have pardoned
in almost any man; but no such indication is to be
traced here.  In his unexampled situation the young
peasant is not a moment perplexed; so many strange
lights do not confuse him, do not lead him astray.
Nevertheless, we cannot but perceive that this
winter did him great and lasting injury.  A somewhat
clearer knowledge of men's affairs, scarcely of their
characters, it did afford him; but a sharper feeling
of Fortune's unequal arrangements in their social
destiny it also left with him.  He had seen the gay
and gorgeous arena, in which the powerful are born
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
to play their parts; nay had himself stood in the
midst of it; and he felt more bitterly than ever, that
here he was but a looker-on, and had no part or lot
in that splendid game.  From this time a jealous
indignant fear of social degradation takes possession of
him; and perverts, so far as aught could pervert, his
private contentment, and his feelings towards his
richer fellows.  It was clear to Burns that he had
talent enough to make a fortune, or a hundred
fortunes, could he but have rightly willed this; it was
clear also that he willed something far different, and
therefore could not make one.  Unhappy it was that
he had not power to choose the one, and reject the
other; but must halt forever between two opinions,
two objects; making hampered advancement towards
either.  But so is it with many men: we "long for
the merchandise, yet would fain keep the price;" and
so stand chaffering with Fate in vexatious altercation,
till the night come, and our fair is over!
</p>

<p>
The Edinburgh Learned of that period were in
general more noted for clearness of head than for
warmth of heart: with the exception of the good old
Blacklock,[<a id="chap01fn93text"></a><a href="#chap01fn93">93</a>] whose help was too ineffectual, scarcely
one among them seems to have looked at Burns with
any true sympathy, or indeed much otherwise than as
at a highly curious <i>thing</i>.  By the great also he is
treated in the customary fashion; entertained at their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P63"></a>63}</span>
tables and dismissed: certain modica of pudding and
praise are, from time to time, gladly exchanged for
the fascination of his presence; which exchange once
effected, the bargain is finished, and each party goes
his several way.  At the end of this strange season,
Burns gloomily sums up his gains and losses, and
meditates on the chaotic future.  In money he is
somewhat richer; in fame and the show of happiness,
infinitely richer; but in the substance of it, as poor
as ever.  Nay poorer; for his heart is now maddened
still more with the fever of worldly Ambition; and
through long years the disease will rack him with
unprofitable sufferings, and weaken his strength for all
true and nobler aims.
</p>

<p>
What Burns was next to do or to avoid; how a
man so circumstanced was now to guide himself
towards his true advantage, might at this point of
time have been a question for the wisest.  It was a
question too, which apparently he was left altogether
to answer for himself: of his learned or rich patrons
it had not struck any individual to turn a thought on
this so trivial matter.  Without claiming for Burns
the praise of perfect sagacity, we must say, that his
Excise and Farm scheme does not seem to us a very
unreasonable one; that we should be at a loss, even
now, to suggest one decidedly better.  Certain of his
admirers have felt scandalized at his ever resolving
to <i>gauge</i>; and would have had him lie at the pool,
till the spirit of Patronage stirred the waters, that
so, with one friendly plunge, all his sorrows might
be healed.[<a id="chap01fn94text"></a><a href="#chap01fn94">94</a>] Unwise counsellors!  They know not
the manner of this spirit; and how, in the lap of
most golden dreams, a man might have happiness,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
were it not that in the interim he must die of hunger!
It reflects credit on the manliness and sound sense of
Burns, that he felt so early on what ground he was
standing; and preferred self-help, on the humblest
scale, to dependence and inaction, though with hope
of far more splendid possibilities.  But even these
possibilities were not rejected in his scheme: he might
expect, if it chanced that he <i>had</i> any friend, to rise,
in no long period, into something even like opulence
and leisure; while again, if it chanced that he had
no friend, he could still live in security; and for the
rest, he "did not intend to borrow honor from any
profession."[<a id="chap01fn95text"></a><a href="#chap01fn95">95</a>]  We reckon that his plan was honest
and well-calculated: all turned on the execution of it.
Doubtless it failed; yet not, we believe, from any
vice inherent in itself.[<a id="chap01fn96text"></a><a href="#chap01fn96">96</a>]  Nay, after all, it was no
failure of external means, but of internal, that
overtook Burns.  His was no bankruptcy of the purse,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
but of the soul; to his last day, he owed no man any
thing.[<a id="chap01fn97text"></a><a href="#chap01fn97">97</a>]
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he begins well: with two good and wise
actions.  His donation to his mother, munificent from
a man whose income had lately been seven pounds
a-year, was worthy of him, and not more than worthy.
Generous also, and worthy of him, was the treatment
of the woman whose life's welfare now depended on
his pleasure.  A friendly observer might have hoped
serene days for him: his mind is on the true road
to peace with itself: what clearness he still wants
will be given as he proceeds; for the best teacher of
duties, that still lie dim to us, is the Practice of those
we see and have at hand.  Had the "patrons of genius,"
who could give him nothing, but taken nothing
from him, at least nothing more!  The wounds of his
heart would have healed, vulgar ambition would have
died away.  Toil and frugality would have been
welcome, since Virtue dwelt with them; and Poetry
would have shone through them as of old: and in her
clear ethereal light, which was his own by birthright,
he might have looked down on his earthly destiny,
and all its obstructions, not with patience only, but
with love.
</p>

<p>
But the patrons of genius would not have it so.
Picturesque tourists,[<a id="chap01fn98text"></a><a href="#chap01fn98">98</a>] all manner of fashionable
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
danglers after literature, and, far worse, all manner of
convivial Mæcenases,[<a id="chap01fn99text"></a><a href="#chap01fn99">99</a>] hovered round him in his
retreat; and his good as well as his weak qualities
secured them influence over him.  He was flattered by
their notice; and his warm social nature made it
impossible for him to shake them off, and hold on his
way apart from them.  These men, as we believe,
were proximately the means of his ruin.  Not that
they meant him any ill; they only meant themselves
a little good; if he suffered harm, let <i>him</i> look to it!
But they wasted his precious time and his precious
talent; they disturbed his composure, broke down
his returning habits of temperance and assiduous
contented exertion.  Their pampering was baneful to
him; their cruelty, which soon followed, was equally
baneful.  The old grudge against Fortune's inequality
awoke with new bitterness in their neighborhood;
and Burns had no retreat but to "the Rock of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
Independence," which is but an air-castle after all, that
looks well at a distance, but will screen no one from
real wind and wet.  Flushed with irregular excitement,
exasperated alternately by contempt of others,
and contempt of himself, Burns was no longer
regaining his peace of mind, but fast losing it forever.
There was a hollowness at the heart of his life, for
his conscience did not now approve what he was
doing.
</p>

<p>
Amid the vapors of unwise enjoyment, of bootless
remorse, and angry discontent with Fate, his true
loadstar, a life of Poetry, with Poverty, nay with
Famine if it must be so, was too often altogether
hidden from his eyes.  And yet he sailed a sea,
where without some such loadstar there was no right
steering.  Meteors of French Politics rise before him,
but these were not <i>his</i> stars.  An accident this, which
hastened, but did not originate, his worst distresses.
In the mad contentions of that time, he comes in
collision with certain official Superiors; is wounded by
them; cruelly lacerated, we should say, could a dead
mechanical implement, in any case, be called cruel:
and shrinks, in indignant pain, into deeper self-seclusion,
into gloomier moodiness than ever.  His life
has now lost its unity: it is a life of fragments; led
with little aim, beyond the melancholy one of securing
its own continuance,&mdash;in fits of wild false joy when
such offered, and of black despondency when they
passed away.  His character before the world begins
to suffer: calumny is busy with him; for a miserable
man makes more enemies than friends.  Some faults
he has fallen into, and a thousand misfortunes; but
deep criminality is what he stands accused of, and
they that are <i>not</i> without sin cast the first stone at
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P68"></a>68}</span>
him!  For is he not a well-wisher to the French
Revolution, a Jacobin, and therefore in that one act
guilty of all?  These accusations, political and moral,
it has since appeared, were false enough: but the
world hesitated little to credit them.[<a id="chap01fn100text"></a><a href="#chap01fn100">100</a>]  Nay his
convivial Mæcenases themselves were not the last to do it.
There is reason to believe that, in his later years,
the Dumfries Aristocracy had partly withdrawn themselves
from Burns, as from a tainted person, no longer
worthy of their acquaintance.  That painful class,
stationed, in all provincial cities, behind the outmost
breastwork of Gentility, there to stand siege and do
battle against the intrusions of Grocerdom and
Grazierdom, had actually seen dishonor in the society of
Burns, and branded him with their veto; had, as we
vulgarly say, <i>cut</i> him!  We find one passage in this
Work of Mr. Lockhart's, which will not out of our
thoughts:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman of that county, whose name I have
already more than once had occasion to refer to, has
often told me that he was seldom more grieved, than
when riding into Dumfries one fine summer evening
about this time to attend a county ball, he saw Burns
walking alone, on the shady side of the principal
street of the town, while the opposite side was gay
with successive groups of gentlemen and ladies, all
drawn together for the festivities of the night, not
one of whom appeared willing to recognize him.  The
horseman dismounted, and joined Burns, who on his
proposing to cross the street said: 'Nay, nay, my
young friend, that's all over now;' and quoted, after
a pause, some verses of Lady Grizzel Baillie's pathetic
ballad:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'His bonnet stood ance fu' fair on his brow,<br>
  His auld ane look'd better than mony ane's new;<br>
  But now he lets 't wear ony way it will hing,<br>
  And casts himsell dowie upon the corn-bing.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'O, were we young as we ance hae been,<br>
  We sud hae been gallopping down on yon green,<br>
  And linking it ower the lily-white lea!<br>
  <i>And werena my heart light, I wad die</i>.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
It was little in Burns's character to let his feelings
on certain subjects escape in this fashion.  He,
immediately after reciting these verses, assumed the
sprightliness of his most pleasing manner; and taking
his young friend home with him, entertained him
very agreeably till the hour of the ball arrived."[<a id="chap01fn101text"></a><a href="#chap01fn101">101</a>]
</p>

<p>
Alas! when we think that Burns now sleeps "where
bitter indignation can no longer lacerate his heart,"[<a id="chap01fn102text"></a><a href="#chap01fn102">102</a>]
and that most of those fair dames and frizzled gentlemen
already lie at his side, where the breastwork of
gentility is quite thrown down,&mdash;who would not sigh
over the thin delusions and foolish toys that divide
heart from heart, and make man unmerciful to his
brother!
</p>

<p>
It was not now to be hoped that the genius of
Burns would ever reach maturity, or accomplish aught
worthy of itself.  His spirit was jarred in its melody;
not the soft breath of natural feeling, but the rude
hand of Fate, was now sweeping over the strings.
And yet what harmony was in him, what music even
in his discords!  How the wild tones had a charm for
the simplest and the wisest; and all men felt and
knew that here also was one of the Gifted!  "If he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
entered an inn at midnight, after all the inmates were
in bed, the news of his arrival circulated from the
cellar to the garret; and ere ten minutes had elapsed,
the landlord and all his guests were assembled!"  Some
brief pure moments of poetic life were yet
appointed him, in the composition of his Songs.  We
can understand how he grasped at this employment;
and how, too, he spurned all other reward for it but
what the labor itself brought him.  For the soul of
Burns, though scathed and marred, was yet living in
its full moral strength, though sharply conscious of
its errors and abasement; and here, in his destitution
and degradation, was one act of seeming nobleness
and self-devotedness left even for him to perform.
He felt, too, that with all the "thoughtless follies"
that had "laid him low,"[<a id="chap01fn103text"></a><a href="#chap01fn103">103</a>] the world was unjust and
cruel to him; and he silently appealed to another and
calmer time.  Not as a hired soldier, but as a patriot,
would he strive for the glory of his country: so he
cast from him the poor sixpence a-day, and served
zealously as a volunteer.  Let us not grudge him this
last luxury of his existence; let him not have appealed
to us in vain!  The money was not necessary to him;
he struggled through without it: long since, these
guineas would have been gone, and now the high-mindedness
of refusing them will plead for him in all
hearts forever.
</p>

<p>
We are here arrived at the crisis of Burns's life;
for matters had now taken such a shape with him as
could not long continue.  If improvement was not to
be looked for, Nature could only for a limited time
maintain this dark and maddening warfare against
the world and itself.  We are not medically informed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
whether any continuance of years was, at this period,
probable for Burns; whether his death is to be looked
on as in some sense an accidental event, or only as
the natural consequence of the long series of events
that had preceded.  The latter seems to be the likelier
opinion; and yet it is by no means a certain one.
At all events, as we have said, <i>some</i> change could not
be very distant.  Three gates of deliverance, it seems
to us, were open for Burns: clear poetical activity;
madness; or death.  The first, with longer life, was
still possible, though not probable; for physical causes
were beginning to be concerned in it: and yet Burns
had an iron resolution; could he but have seen and
felt, that not only his highest glory, but his first
duty, and the true medicine for all his woes, lay here.
The second was still less probable; for his mind was
ever among the clearest and firmest.  So the milder
third gate was opened for him: and he passed, not
softly yet speedily, into that still country, where the
hail-storms and fire-showers do not reach, and the
heaviest-laden wayfarer at length lays down his load!
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Contemplating this sad end of Burns, and how he
sank unaided by any real help, uncheered by any
wise sympathy, generous minds have sometimes figured
to themselves, with a reproachful sorrow, that
much might have been done for him; that by counsel,
true affection and friendly ministrations, he might
have been saved to himself and the world.  We
question whether there is not more tenderness of heart
than soundness of judgment in these suggestions.  It
seems dubious to us whether the richest, wisest, most
benevolent individual could have lent Burns any
effectual help.  Counsel, which seldom profits any one,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
he did not need; in his understanding, he knew the
right from the wrong, as well perhaps as any man
ever did; but the persuasion, which would have
availed him, lies not so much in the head as in the
heart, where no argument or expostulation could have
assisted much to implant it.  As to money again, we
do not believe that this was his essential want; or
well see how any private man could, even presupposing
Burns's consent, have bestowed on him an independent
fortune, with much prospect of decisive
advantage.  It is a mortifying truth, that two men, in
any rank of society, could hardly be found virtuous
enough to give money, and to take it as a necessary
gift, without injury to the moral entireness of one or
both.  But so stands the fact: Friendship, in the old
heroic sense of that term, no longer exists: except in
the cases of kindred or other legal affinity, it is in
reality no longer expected, or recognized as a virtue
among men.  A close observer of manners has
pronounced "Patronage," that is, pecuniary or other
economic furtherance, to be "twice cursed;" cursing
him that gives, and him that takes![<a id="chap01fn104text"></a><a href="#chap01fn104">104</a>]  And thus,
in regard to outward matters also, it has become the
rule, as in regard to inward it always was and must
be the rule, that no one shall look for effectual help
to another; but that each shall rest contented with
what help he can afford himself.  Such, we say, is
the principle of modern Honor; naturally enough
growing out of that sentiment of Pride, which we
inculcate and encourage as the basis of our whole social
morality.  Many a poet has been poorer than Burns;
but no one was ever prouder: we may question
whether, without great precautions, even a pension
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
from Royalty would not have galled and encumbered,
more than actually assisted him.
</p>

<p>
Still less, therefore, are we disposed to join with
another class of Burns's admirers, who accuse the
higher ranks among us of having ruined Burns by
their selfish neglect of him.  We have already stated
our doubts whether direct pecuniary help, had it been
offered, would have been accepted, or could have
proved very effectual.  We shall readily admit,
however, that much was to be done for Burns; that many
a poisoned arrow might have been warded from his
bosom; many an entanglement in his path cut asunder
by the hand of the powerful; and light and heat,
shed on him from high places, would have made his
humble atmosphere more genial; and the softest heart
then breathing might have lived and died with some
fewer pangs.  Nay, we shall grant farther, and for
Burns it is granting much, that, with all his pride,
he would have thanked, even with exaggerated
gratitude, any one who had cordially befriended him:
patronage, unless once cursed, needed not to have
been twice so.  At all events, the poor promotion he
desired in his calling might have been granted: it
was his own scheme, therefore likelier than any other
to be of service.  All this it might have been a
luxury, nay it was a duty, for our nobility to have done.
No part of all this, however, did any of them do; or
apparently attempt, or wish to do: so much is granted
against them.  But what then is the amount of their
blame?  Simply that they were men of the world,
and walked by the principles of such men; that they
treated Burns, as other nobles and other commoners
had done other poets; as the English did Shakespeare;
as King Charles and his Cavaliers did
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
Butler,[<a id="chap01fn105text"></a><a href="#chap01fn105">105</a>] as King Philip and his Grandees did Cervantes.
Do men gather grapes of thorns;[<a id="chap01fn106text"></a><a href="#chap01fn106">106</a>] or shall we cut
down our thorns for yielding only a <i>fence</i> and haws?
How, indeed, could the "nobility and gentry of his
native land" hold out any help to this "Scottish
Bard, proud of his name and country"?[<a id="chap01fn107text"></a><a href="#chap01fn107">107</a>]  Were the
nobility and gentry so much as able rightly to help
themselves?  Had they not their game to preserve;
their borough interests to strengthen; dinners,
therefore, of various kinds to eat and give?  Were their
means more than adequate to all this business, or less
than adequate?  Less than adequate, in general; few
of them in reality were richer than Burns; many of
them were poorer; for sometimes they had to wring
their supplies, as with thumbscrews, from the hard
hand; and, in their need of guineas, to forget their
duty of mercy; which Burns was never reduced to
do.  Let us pity and forgive them.  The game they
preserved and shot, the dinners they ate and gave,
the borough interests they strengthened, the <i>little</i>
Babylons they severally builded by the glory of their
might,[<a id="chap01fn108text"></a><a href="#chap01fn108">108</a>] are all melted or melting back into the
primeval Chaos, as man's merely selfish endeavors are
fated to do: and here was an action, extending, in
virtue of its worldly influence, we may say, through all
time; in virtue of its moral nature, beyond all time,
being immortal as the Spirit of Goodness itself; this
action was offered them to do, and light was not given
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
them to do it.  Let us pity and forgive them.  But
better than pity, let us go and <i>do otherwise</i>.  Human
suffering did not end with the life of Burns; neither
was the solemn mandate, "Love one another, bear
one another's burdens,"[<a id="chap01fn109text"></a><a href="#chap01fn109">109</a>] given to the rich only, but
to all men.  True, we shall find no Burns to relieve,
to assuage by our aid or our pity; but celestial
natures, groaning under the fardels of a weary life, we
shall still find; and that wretchedness which Fate
has rendered <i>voiceless</i> and <i>tuneless</i> is not the least
wretched, but the most.[<a id="chap01fn110text"></a><a href="#chap01fn110">110</a>]
</p>

<p>
Still we do not think that the blame of Burns's
failure lies chiefly with the world.  The world, it
seems to us, treated him with more rather than with
less kindness than it usually shows to such men.  It
has ever, we fear, shown but small favor to its
Teachers: hunger and nakedness, perils and revilings, the
prison, the cross, the poison-chalice have, in most
times and countries, been the market-price it has
offered for Wisdom, the welcome with which it has
greeted those who have come to enlighten and purify
it.  Homer and Socrates, and the Christian Apostles,
belong to old days; but the world's Martyrology was
not completed with these.  Roger Bacon and Galileo
languish in priestly dungeons; Tasso pines in the cell
of a madhouse; Camoens dies begging on the streets
of Lisbon.[<a id="chap01fn111text"></a><a href="#chap01fn111">111</a>]  So neglected, so "persecuted they the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
Prophets,"[<a id="chap01fn112text"></a><a href="#chap01fn112">112</a>] not in Judea only, but in all places
where men have been.  We reckon that every poet
of Burns's order is, or should be, a prophet and
teacher to his age; that he has no right to expect
great kindness from it, but rather is bound to do it
great kindness; that Burns, in particular, experienced
fully the usual proportion of the world's goodness;
and that the blame of his failure, as we have said,
lies not chiefly with the world.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, does it lie?  We are forced to
answer: With himself; it is his inward, not his
outward, misfortunes that bring him to the dust.
Seldom, indeed, is it otherwise; seldom is a life morally
wrecked but the grand cause lies in some internal
mal-arrangement, some want less of good fortune
than of good guidance.  Nature fashions no creature
without implanting in it the strength needful for its
action and duration; least of all does she so neglect
her masterpiece and darling, the poetic soul.  Neither
can we believe that it is in the power of <i>any</i>
external circumstances utterly to ruin the mind of a man;
nay, if proper wisdom be given him, even so much as
to affect its essential health and beauty.  The
sternest sum-total of all worldly misfortunes is Death;
nothing more <i>can</i> lie in the cup of human woe: yet
many men, in all ages, have triumphed over Death,
and led it captive;[<a id="chap01fn113text"></a><a href="#chap01fn113">113</a>] converting its physical victory
into a moral victory for themselves, into a seal and
immortal consecration for all that their past life had
achieved.  What has been done, may be done again:
nay it is but the degree and not the kind of such
heroism that differs in different seasons; for without
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
some portion of this spirit, not of boisterous daring,
but of silent fearlessness, of Self-denial in all its
forms, no good man, in any scene or time, has ever
attained to be good.[<a id="chap01fn114text"></a><a href="#chap01fn114">114</a>]
</p>

<p>
We have already stated the error of Burns; and
mourned over it, rather than blamed it.  It was the
want of unity in his purposes, of consistency in his
aims; the hapless attempt to mingle in friendly union
the common spirit of the world with the spirit of
poetry, which is of a far different and altogether
irreconcilable nature.  Burns was nothing wholly, and
Burns could be nothing, no man formed as he was can
be anything, by halves.  The heart, not of a mere
hot-blooded, popular Verse-monger, or poetical
<i>Restaurateur</i>,[<a id="chap01fn115text"></a><a href="#chap01fn115">115</a>] but of a true Poet and Singer, worthy of the
old religious heroic times, had been given him: and he
fell in an age, not of heroism and religion, but of
scepticism, selfishness, and triviality, when true Nobleness
was little understood, and its place supplied by a
hollow, dissocial, altogether barren and unfruitful
principle of Pride.  The influences of that age, his open,
kind, susceptible nature, to say nothing of his highly
untoward situation, made it more than usually difficult
for him to cast aside, or rightly subordinate; the
better spirit that was within him ever sternly
demanded its rights, its supremacy: he spent his life in
endeavoring to reconcile these two; and lost it, as he
must lose it, without reconciling them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
</p>

<p>
Burns was born poor; and born also to continue
poor, for he would not endeavor to be otherwise: this
it had been well could he have once for all admitted,
and considered as finally settled.  He was poor, truly;
but hundreds even of his own class and order of minds
have been poorer, yet have suffered nothing deadly
from it: nay his own Father had a far sorer battle
with ungrateful destiny than his was; and he did not
yield to it, but died courageously warring, and to
all moral intents prevailing, against it.  True, Burns
had little means, had even little time for poetry, his
only real pursuit and vocation; but so much the more
precious was what little he had.  In all these
external respects his case was hard; but very far from
the hardest.  Poverty, incessant drudgery and much
worse evils, it has often been the lot of Poets and
wise men to strive with, and their glory to conquer.
Locke was banished as a traitor; and wrote his
"Essay on the Human Understanding" sheltering himself
in a Dutch garret.  Was Milton rich or at his ease
when he composed "Paradise Lost"?  Not only
low, but fallen from a height; not only poor, but
impoverished; in darkness and with dangers compassed
round, he sang his immortal song, and found fit
audience, though few.[<a id="chap01fn116text"></a><a href="#chap01fn116">116</a>]  Did not Cervantes finish his
work, a maimed soldier and in prison?  Nay, was
not the "Araucana,"[<a id="chap01fn117text"></a><a href="#chap01fn117">117</a>] which Spain acknowledges as
its Epic, written without even the aid of paper; on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
scraps of leather, as the stout fighter and voyager
snatched any moment from that wild warfare?
</p>

<p>
And what, then, had these men, which Burns
wanted?  Two things; both which, it seems to us,
are indispensable for such men.  They had a true,
religious principle of morals; and a single, not a
double aim in their activity.  They were not
self-seekers and self-worshippers; but seekers and
worshippers of something far better than Self.  Not
personal enjoyment was their object; but a high,
heroic idea of Religion, of Patriotism, of heavenly
Wisdom, in one or the other form, ever hovered
before them; in which cause they neither shrank from
suffering, nor called on the earth to witness it as
something wonderful; but patiently endured, counting
it blessedness enough so to spend and be spent.
Thus the "golden-calf of Self-love," however curiously
carved, was not their Deity; but the Invisible
Goodness, which alone is man's reasonable service.  This
feeling was as a celestial fountain, whose streams
refreshed into gladness and beauty all the provinces
of their otherwise too desolate existence.  In a word,
they willed one thing, to which all other things were
subordinated and made subservient; and therefore
they accomplished it.  The wedge will rend rocks;
but its edge must be sharp and single: if it be double,
the wedge is bruised in pieces and will rend nothing.
</p>

<p>
Part of this superiority these men owed to their
age; in which heroism and devotedness were still
practised, or at least not yet disbelieved in; but
much of it likewise they owed to themselves.  With
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
Burns, again, it was different.  His morality, in
most of its practical points, is that of a mere worldly
man; enjoyment, in a finer or coarser shape, is the
only thing he longs and strives for.  A noble instinct
sometimes raises him above this; but an instinct
only, and acting only for moments.  He has no
Religion; in the shallow age, where his days were cast,
Religion was not discriminated from the New and
Old Light <i>forms</i> of Religion; and was, with these,
becoming obsolete in the minds of men.  His heart,
indeed, is alive with a trembling adoration, but there
is no temple in his understanding.  He lives in
darkness and in the shadow of doubt.  His religion, at
best, is an anxious wish; like that of Rabelais, "a
great Perhaps."
</p>

<p>
He loved Poetry warmly, and in his heart; could
he but have loved it purely, and with his whole
undivided heart, it had been well.  For Poetry, as Burns
could have followed it, is but another form of
Wisdom, of Religion: is itself Wisdom and Religion.
But this also was denied him.  His poetry is a stray
vagrant gleam, which will not be extinguished within
him, yet rises not to be the true light of his path,
but is often a wildfire that misleads him.  It was not
necessary for Burns to be rich, to be, or to seem,
"independent;" but it <i>was</i> necessary for him to be
at one with his own heart; to place what was highest
in his nature highest also in his life; "to seek within
himself for that consistency and sequence, which
external events would forever refuse him."  He was
born a poet; poetry was the celestial element of his
being, and should have been the soul of his whole
endeavors.  Lifted into that serene ether, whither he
had wings given him to mount, he would have needed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
no other elevation: poverty, neglect, and all evil,
save the desecration of himself and his Art, were a
small matter to him; the pride and the passions of
the world lay far beneath his feet; and he looked
down alike on noble and slave, on prince and beggar,
and all that wore the stamp of man, with clear
recognition, with brotherly affection, with sympathy, with
pity.  Nay, we question whether for his culture as
a Poet poverty and much suffering for a season were
not absolutely advantageous.  Great men, in looking
back over their lives, have testified to that effect.
"I would not for much," says Jean Paul, "that I
had been born richer."  And yet Paul's birth was
poor enough; for, in another place, he adds: "The
prisoner's allowance is bread and water; and I had
often only the latter."[<a id="chap01fn118text"></a><a href="#chap01fn118">118</a>]  But the gold that is refined
in the hottest furnace comes out the purest; or, as
he has himself expressed it, "the canary-bird sings
sweeter the longer it has been trained in a darkened
cage."
</p>

<p>
A man like Burns might have divided his hours
between poetry and virtuous industry; industry which
all true feeling sanctions, nay prescribes, and which
has a beauty, for that cause, beyond the pomp of
thrones: but to divide his hours between poetry and
rich men's banquets was an ill-starred and inauspicious
attempt.  How could he be at ease at such banquets?
What had he to do there, mingling his music
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
with the coarse roar of altogether earthly voices;
brightening the thick smoke of intoxication with fire
lent him from heaven?  Was it his aim to enjoy life!
To-morrow he must go drudge as an Exciseman!
We wonder not that Burns became moody, indignant,
and at times an offender against certain rules of
society; but rather that he did not grow utterly frantic,
and run <i>amuck</i> against them all.  How could a man,
so falsely placed, by his own or others' fault, ever
know contentment or peaceable diligence for an hour?
What he did, under such perverse guidance, and
what he forbore to do, alike fill us with astonishment
at the natural strength and worth of his character.
</p>

<p>
Doubtless there was a remedy for this perverseness;
but not in others; only in himself; least of all in
simple increase of wealth and worldly
"respectability."  We hope we have now heard enough about
the efficacy of wealth for poetry, and to make poets
happy.  Nay, have we not seen another instance of
it in these very days?  Byron, a man of an endowment
considerably less ethereal than that of Burns,
is born in the rank not of a Scottish ploughman, but
of an English peer: the highest worldly honors, the
fairest worldly career, are his by inheritance; the
richest harvest of fame he soon reaps, in another
province, by his own hand.  And what does all this
avail him?  Is he happy, is he good, is he true?
Alas, he has a poet's soul, and strives towards the
Infinite and the Eternal; and soon feels that all this
is but mounting to the housetop to reach the stars!
Like Burns, he is only a proud man; might, like
him, have "purchased a pocket-copy of Milton to
study the character of Satan;" for Satan is also
Byron's grand exemplar, the hero of his poetry, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
the model apparently of his conduct.[<a id="chap01fn119text"></a><a href="#chap01fn119">119</a>]  As in Burns's
case too, the celestial element will not mingle with
the clay of earth; both poet and man of the world he
must not be; vulgar Ambition will not live kindly
with poetic Adoration; he <i>cannot</i> serve God and
Mammon.  Byron, like Burns, is not happy; nay he is
the most wretched of all men.  His life is falsely
arranged: the fire that is in him is not a strong,
still, central fire, warming into beauty the products
of a world; but it is the mad fire of a volcano; and
now&mdash;we look sadly into the ashes of a crater, which
ere long will fill itself with snow!
</p>

<p>
Byron and Burns were sent forth as missionaries
to their generation, to teach it a higher Doctrine, a
purer Truth; they had a message to deliver, which
left them no rest till it was accomplished; in dim
throes of pain, this divine behest lay smouldering
within them; for they knew not what it meant, and
felt it only in mysterious anticipation, and they had
to die without articulately uttering it.  They are in
the camp of the Unconverted; yet not as high
messengers of rigorous though benignant truth, but as
soft flattering singers, and in pleasant fellowship will
they live there: they are first adulated, then persecuted;
they accomplish little for others; they find no
peace for themselves, but only death and the peace of
the grave.  We confess, it is not without a certain
mournful awe that we view the fate of these noble
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
souls, so richly gifted, yet ruined to so little purpose
with all their gifts.  It seems to us there is a stern
moral taught in this piece of history,&mdash;<i>twice</i> told us
in our own time!  Surely to men of like genius, if
there be any such, it carries with it a lesson of deep
impressive significance.  Surely it would become such
a man, furnished for the highest of all enterprises,
that of being the Poet of his Age, to consider well
what it is that he attempts, and in what spirit he
attempts it.  For the words of Milton are true in all
times, and were never truer than in this: "He who
would write heroic poems must make his whole life
a heroic poem."[<a id="chap01fn120text"></a><a href="#chap01fn120">120</a>]  If he cannot first so make his life,
then let him hasten from this arena; for neither its
lofty glories, nor its fearful perils, are fit for him.
Let him dwindle into a modish balladmonger; let
him worship and besing the idols of the time, and the
time will not fail to reward him.  If, indeed, he can
endure to live in that capacity!  Byron and Burns
could not live as idol-priests, but the fire of their own
hearts consumed them; and better it was for them
that they could not.  For it is not in the favor of
the great or of the small, but in a life of truth, and
in the inexpugnable citadel of his own soul, that a
Byron's or a Burns's strength must lie.  Let the
great stand aloof from him, or know how to reverence
him.  Beautiful is the union of wealth with favor
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
and furtherance for literature; like the costliest
flower-jar enclosing the loveliest amaranth.  Yet let
not the relation be mistaken.  A true poet is not one
whom they can hire by money or flattery to be a
minister of their pleasures; their writer of occasional
verses, their purveyor of table-wit; he cannot be their
menial, he cannot even be their partisan.  At the
peril of both parties, let no such union be attempted!
Will a Courser of the Sun work softly in the harness
of a Dray-horse?  His hoofs are of fire, and his path
is through the heavens, bringing light to all lands;
will he lumber on mud highways, dragging ale for
earthly appetites from door to door?
</p>

<p>
But we must stop short in these considerations,
which would lead us to boundless lengths.  We had
something to say on the public moral character of
Burns; but this also we must forbear.  We are far
from regarding him as guilty before the world, as
guiltier than the average; nay from doubting that he
is less guilty than one of ten thousand.  Tried at a
tribunal far more rigid than that where the <i>Plebiscita</i>
of common civic reputations are pronounced, he
has seemed to us even there less worthy of blame than
of pity and wonder.  But the world is habitually
unjust in its judgments of such men; unjust on many
grounds, of which this one may be stated as the
substance: It decides, like a court of law, by dead
statutes; and not positively but negatively, less on what
is done right, than on what is or is not done wrong.
Not the few inches of deflection from the mathematical
orbit, which are so easily measured, but the <i>ratio</i>
of these to the whole diameter, constitutes the real
aberration.  This orbit may be a planet's, its diameter
the breadth of the solar system; or it may be a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
city hippodrome; nay the circle of a ginhorse, its
diameter a score of feet or paces.  But the inches of
deflection only are measured: and it is assumed that
the diameter of the ginhorse, and that of the planet,
will yield the same ratio when compared with them!
Here lies the root of many a blind, cruel condemnation
of Burnses, Swifts, Rousseaus, which one never
listens to with approval.  Granted, the ship comes
into harbor with shrouds and tackle damaged; the
pilot is blameworthy; he has not been all-wise and
all-powerful: but to know <i>how</i> blameworthy, tell us first
whether his voyage has been round the Globe, or only
to Ramsgate and the Isle of Dogs.[<a id="chap01fn121text"></a><a href="#chap01fn121">121</a>]
</p>

<p>
With our readers in general, with men of right
feeling anywhere, we are not required to plead for
Burns.  In pitying admiration he lies enshrined in
all our hearts, in a far nobler mausoleum than that
one of marble; neither will his Works, even as they
are, pass away from the memory of men.  While the
Shakespeares and Miltons roll on like mighty rivers
through the country of Thought, bearing fleets of
traffickers and assiduous pearl-fishers on their waves;
this little Valclusa[<a id="chap01fn122text"></a><a href="#chap01fn122">122</a>] Fountain will also arrest our eye:
for this also is of Nature's own and most cunning
workmanship, bursts from the depths of the earth,
with a full gushing current, into the light of day;
and often will the traveller turn aside to drink of its
clear waters, and muse among its rocks and pines.

[<a href="#chap01fn9text">9</a>] <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> owed much of its success to Archibald
Constable, its first printer.  Constable rose to be one of the
chief publishers of his time, and is especially famous for his
connection with Scott, but became bankrupt in 1826.  <i>Constable's
Miscellany of Original and Selected Publications in Literature,
Science, and the Arts</i> has a pathetic interest as being the poor
fulfilment of a scheme that he had formed, before his failure, of
a series of cheap volumes that should sell, he told Scott, "not by
thousands or tens of thousands, but by hundreds of thousands&mdash;aye,
by millions."

<a id="chap01fn11"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn11text">11</a>] Carlyle's judgment on Lockhart's work seems to have improved
with reflection.  In a letter to his brother, June 10, 1828,
he writes: "Lockhart had written a kind of <i>Life of Burns</i>, and
men in general were making another uproar about Burns; it is
this Book (a trivial enough one) which I am to <i>pretend</i> reviewing."

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn12"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn12text">12</a>] The apologetic expressions in the early part of this essay
may, as Mr. H. W. Boynton well suggests in his excellent
edition, be relics of Jeffrey's editing.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn13"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn13text">13</a>] Carlyle is always extreme in his judgments, and here is
unjustly contemptuous of men whom, as the quotation from Scott
below (p. 60) will show, Burns always regarded as his models,
and whom he often directly and openly imitated.  Ramsay has
been admired by men as different as Pope and Leigh Hunt; and
Stevenson, whose estimate of these men in his essay on <i>Some
Aspects of Robert Burns</i> it would be well to read, places the
"poor lad Fergusson" even higher than Ramsay.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn14"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn14text">14</a>] Here Carlyle touches on the source of his own power,&mdash;the

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn15"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn15text">15</a>] The <i>Tragic Fragment</i> printed in Burns's works was written
when he was only nineteen.  And in 1790 Burns told friends
that he was preparing to write a play on a subject drawn from
Scottish history.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn16"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn16text">16</a>] Though Carlyle never changed his opinion of a true poet,
his later writings show a very different estimate of the value of
conquerors to the world.  After his removal to London, he
writes but little on literature,
and is usually full of scorn for the
profession of letters.  He tends to idealize mere strength of will
and brute force of character, if accompanied by sincerity.  He
praises the power of silent action; and his favorite heroes are
men of deeds, like Cromwell and Frederick.

[<a href="#chap01fn21text">21</a>] Sincerity is the test by which Carlyle judges all men; praise

[<a href="#chap01fn22text">22</a>] "How perpetually he [Burns] was alive to the dread of
being looked down on as a man, even by those who most
zealously applauded the works of his genius, might perhaps be
traced through the whole sequence of his letters.  When writing

[<a href="#chap01fn23text">23</a>] Scott, Byron, Moore, Southey, and Cooper are the most

Carlyle, because of his intense moral earnestness, had no
sympathy with literature written only to give amusement,
regardless of truth to life.  As usual,
his view, though stimulating,
is one-sided.  Many of the most justly famous books, notably
the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, are great by the pure charm of incident and
invention.

[<a href="#chap01fn42text">42</a>] In this sentence, as printed in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, we

There, by the change of <i>weak-eyed maudlin</i> into <i>extreme</i>, and of

Elsewhere Carlyle says of Keats: "The kind of man he was
gets ever more horrible to me.  Force of hunger for pleasure of
every kind, and want of all other force....  Such a structure
of soul, it would once have been very evident, was a chosen
'Vessel of Hell.'" (Nichol: <i>Life of Carlyle</i>, chap. v.)  Such

necessity of a moral aim in all literature.

flood-gates of life shut in eternal rest."  The reader will by this
time have noticed Carlyle's carelessness about small points.

[<a href="#chap01fn74text">74</a>] This may refer to Burns's poetical epistles to David Sillar

the neglected grave of Fergusson.

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn77"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn77text">77</a>] Perhaps Carlyle is misled in his estimate of Burns by his
own high conception of the vocation of the man of letters.  The
profession of literature is hardly older than our own century;
Dr. Johnson is really the first example of it.  For a man,
unsupported by a patron, to make poetry his means of subsistence,
was almost unknown in the eighteenth century.  Burns was too
proud to depend on a patron, and his refusal to accept money for
his contributions to Johnson's <i>Museum</i> and Thomson's <i>Scottish
Airs</i> was only in accord with the ideas of his time; besides, he
feared that such a proceeding would injure his spontaneity.  To
receive pay for a volume of poems, originally written without
reference to publication, was quite a different matter.
</p>

<p class="footnote">

[<a href="#chap01fn82text">82</a>] Apparently the "best evidence" is conflicting.  Burns, in
his autobiographical letter to Dr. Moore, says of himself as a
boy: "I was, perhaps, the most ungainly, awkward being in the
parish."  And Murdock, Burns's schoolmaster, in a letter printed
in Currie's <i>Life</i> and reproduced in Lockhart's, says: "Robert's
ear was remarkably dull, and his voice untamable....  Robert's
countenance was generally grave and expressive of a serious,

"This morning I saw at breakfast Dr. Blacklock, the blind

[<a href="#chap01fn95text">95</a>] Words of Burns quoted in Lockhart, chap. vii.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn96"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn96text">96</a>] "If Burns had much of a farmer's skill, he had little of
a farmer's prudence and economy.  I once inquired of James
Corrie, a sagacious old farmer, whose ground marched with
Elliesland, the cause of the poet's failure.  'Faith,' said he,
'how could he miss but fail, when his servants ate the bread as
fast as it was baked?  I don't mean figuratively, I mean
literally.  Consider a little.  At that time close economy was
necessary to have enabled a man to clear twenty pounds a year by
Elliesland.  Now Burns's own handywork was out of the question;
he neither ploughed, nor sowed, nor reaped, at least like a
hard-working farmer; and then he had a bevy of servants from
Ayrshire.  The lasses did nothing but bake bread, and the lads
sat by the fireside, and ate it warm, with ale.  Waste of time
and consumption of food would soon reach to twenty pounds a
year.'"&mdash;(Letter to Lockhart from Allan Cunningham, quoted
in Lockhart's <i>Life</i>, chap, vii.)
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn97"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn97text">97</a>] In reality Burns occasionally borrowed money; but at his
death he left only a few small debts.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap01fn98"></a>
[<a href="#chap01fn98text">98</a>] There is one little sketch by certain "English gentlemen"
of this class, which, though adopted in Currie's narrative, and
since then repeated in most others, we have all along felt
an invincible disposition to regard as imaginary: "On a rock
that projected into the stream, they saw a man employed in
angling, of a singular appearance.  He had a cap made of
fox-skin on his head, a loose greatcoat fixed round him by a belt,
from which depended an enormous Highland broad-sword.  It
was Burns."  Now, we rather think, it was <i>not</i> Burns.  For, to
say nothing of the foxskin cap, the loose and quite Hibernian
watchcoat with the belt, what are we to make of this "enormous
Highland broad-sword" depending from him?  More especially,
as there is no word of parish constables on the outlook to see
whether, as Dennis phrases it, he had an eye to his own midriff
or that of the public!  Burns, of all men, had the least need,
and the least tendency, to seek for distinction, either in his own
eyes or those of others, by such poor mummeries.&mdash;[Carlyle's
note.]
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Carlyle thinks this petty vanity inconsistent with Burns's
wise self-control at Edinburgh.  But we cannot reason thus in
the case of a man with so variable a temperament, and the
anecdote is fairly well authenticated.

Ariosto and Tasso.  Its author, Alonso de Ercilla y Zuniga
(1533-1595), writes of the Spanish campaigns against the
Indians of Arauco, in which he himself took part.  The early part
of the poem was written in the field, in the manner that Carlyle
describes.  The <i>Araucana</i> is now little read; and its author is
no way comparable to the great epic poets of Italy and England.

He is the subject of Carlyle's first essay in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> (1827), and is treated again in another and a greater essay
in the <i>Foreign Review</i> (1830).  These two papers by Carlyle
remain among the best accounts of Richter accessible in English.

all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
